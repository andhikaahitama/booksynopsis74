Stanley Jones: Christ and Human Need</h2><p>Eunice Jones Mathews and James K. Mathews, the editors of Selections from E. Stanley Jones: Christ and Human Need, have carefully selected over five hundred citations from the best of Dr. Jones&#39;s writings. The editors have arranged the citations under twenty-eight topical headings for use as personal inspirational readings, and for speakers and ministers seeking devotional and sermon illustrations. The topics embrace a wide range of subjects, including prayer, political options, surrender, and Christian unity. There are even aphorisms for church bulletin boards. In one of his books, Dr. Jones observed that man has really two great needs: &#34;light on the mystery of life and light for the mastery of life.&#34; The editors have endeavored to choose the passages which speak specifically to these two essentials. As an author, evangelist, lecturer, and world traveler, E. Stanley Jones has been described as &#34;the greatest Christian missionary since St. Paul.&#34; Dr. Jones&#39;s love for his Savior has led thousands to Christ, and his ministry through his books has reached millions, and it is hoped that through this book, he will continue to reach millions more.</p><p></p><h2>Tommy&#39;s War: A First World War Diary</h2><p>The extraordinary diaries of Thomas Cairns Livingstone represent twenty years of gorgeously idiosyncratic daily records of a middle-class Glasgow household, over a period spanning shortly before the Great War to the early 1930s.Thomas Cairns Livingstone, a mercantile book keeper, began his diaries in 1913, when he, his wife Agnes and their son `wee Tommy&#39; set up house in the Glasgow neighbourhood of Govanhill.For the next twenty years, Livingstone dutifully recorded each day&#39;s events in his Collins diaries, from small domestic dramas to troop movements as news of the Great War filtered back to the anxious home front. Rescued during a house clearance, the intricate details of these journals - interspersed throughout with Livingstone&#39;s wonderfully warm and idiosyncratic illustrations - provide a priceless record of the impression world events were making on the ordinary people at home and an extraordinary chronicle of the ups and downs of working-class life in the period immediately before, during and after the First World War.The details of the family&#39;s early life, notes about the (usually dreich) Glasgow weather, and comments on the carnage on the front and on the high seas, are written and illustrated with such warmth and charm that the story of this very ordinary household in the early part of the 20th century becomes completely addictive.</p><p>Thomas Cairns Livingstone was a mercantile book keeper who began his diaries in 1913, when he, his wife Agnes and their son &#39;wee Tommy&#39; set up house in the Glasgow neighbourhood of Govanhill.

Shortly after setting up housekeeping in an abandoned house, Prudence astonishes Hector with a family of six piglets. Leisurely romantic picnics give way to various new parental responsibilities: supervising the children in the bathtub, reading them stories, and getting them to bed. One night, the piglets' parents find a few quiet minutes alone to reflect on their hectic, exhausting lives. At that very moment, the piglets are escaping from their second-story bedroom by climbing down a sheet. While parents may feel a twinge of recognition at Hector and Prudence's conflicting feelings of joy and fatigue, children will have little patience for this light story. A curious flatness and lack of tension in the plot and a tiresome acceptance of the less-than-pleasureable aspects of parenting are not relieved by the humorous, appealing watercolor illustrations. Engaging pig stories abound; although none have the same theme, Rayner's Mr. &amp; Mrs. Pig's Evening Out (Macmillan, 1976), Steig's Amazing Bone (Farrar, 1976), and Van Leeuwen's "Amanda and Oliver Pig" series (Dial) are stories that merit repeated readings. --Ellen Fader, Westport Public Library, CT<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.When a pig named Prudence puts on weight and lobbies to swap her muddy field for a roof over her head, her puzzled mate soon discovers the reason: the arrival of six sprightly pink piglets. The challenges of porcine parenthood generally are faced with equanimity, but by the time their offspring are tucked into bed at night, Hector and Prudence are exhausted. In a final scene that takes a sly poke at the mixed perils and joys of family life, readers see the pooped-out porkers relaxing on lawn chairs under the stars, while in the background their tireless brood clambers down a ladder (made of sheets tied together) to freedom. Koscielniak's rambunctious, jolly illustrations depict a pair of truly contemporary pigs; children and parents alike will find his understated wit hard to resist. Ages 3 - 7. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Old Man and the Sea</h2><p>First published in 1952, the Nobel Prize-winning story tells of an old man&#39;s tragic fishing trip.</p><p>Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honour to the author. In fact <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such post-war stinkers as <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that "no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favourite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: <blockquote> "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords." </blockquote> Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: <blockquote> Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. </blockquote> If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: <blockquote> "The old man was dreaming about the lions." </blockquote> Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. --<i>James Marcus</i>"It is unsurpassed in Hemingway's oeuvre. Every word tells and there is not a word too many" (Anthony Burgess)<br><br>"A quite wonderful example of narrative art. The writing is as taut, and at the same time as lithe and cunningly played out, as the line on which the old man plays the fish" (<i>Guardian</i>)</p><h2>Lost Secrets of Master Musicians: A Window Into Genius</h2><p><i>Can Talent be Explained?&nbsp;</i><br><br>In this groundbreaking look into the world of "classical" music, David Jacobson interweaves his educative experiences at the Curtis Institute of Music with his quest to understand how performers such as Jascha Heifetz, Nathan Milstein, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Vladimir Horowitz, and Glenn Gould achieved such unsurpassed levels of musical expression and technical skill. What were their "secret" techniques and musical insights?&nbsp;Can students learn the principles of musical expression the greatest players used?<br>Jacobson, founder and director of the San Francisco Institute of Music, has spent many years analyzing the approach of these and other master players uncovering their "secrets" which he reveals in clear, precise, non-technical language, supplemented by diagrams, photographs and annotated musical examples. His conclusion: the methods, paradigmatic shifts and musical approach of these masters are <i>fundamentally the same</i>, yet diametrically opposed to what is taught by contemporary music teaching systems (such as those of Ivan Galamian and Shinichi Suzuki, which are both critically examined) for string playing, orchestral instruments, piano and voice. (YouTube videos can now be played at 1/4 and 1/2 speed at pitch.)<br><br>&nbsp;Jacobson's dissatisfaction with contemporary pedagogical methods, which tend to be based on the personal beliefs of particular teachers, led him to search for a more rigorously researched pedagogical platform (by studying the methods of great masters)&nbsp;that could serve as a fundamental paradigmatic model for the teaching of all instruments and voice. His exploration of the "secret" techniques and musical insights of great performers aims to revitalize the art of classical music in general. The rediscovery of these techniques and concepts will:<br><br><ul><li>Provide a paradigmatic pedagogical model for the teaching of all instruments and voice</li><li>Make playing easier and more expressive&nbsp;</li><li>Improve the effectiveness of teaching; the principles of expert playing are clear</li><li>Develop talent naturally, without impediment</li><li>Create many more outstanding performers and composers</li><li>End the need for a conductor's presence in orchestral performance</li><li>Change our ideas about the nature of genius, talent and our own potential</li></ul><br><ul> </ul></p><p><br>Contents<br><br>Author's Note &nbsp; <i>ix</i><br>Preface &nbsp;<i> xi</i><br>Introduction &nbsp;<i> xix</i><br><i></i><br>ACT I &nbsp; GENESIS<br>&nbsp; Chapter 1&nbsp; &nbsp; Beginning &nbsp; <i>3</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 2&nbsp; &nbsp; School &nbsp; <i>9</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 3&nbsp; &nbsp; Jake Krachmalnick &nbsp; <i>17</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 4&nbsp; &nbsp; Philadelphia &nbsp; <i>21</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 5&nbsp; &nbsp; Meadowmount &nbsp; <i>27</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 6&nbsp; &nbsp; Curtis &nbsp; <i>29</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 7&nbsp; &nbsp; Center City &nbsp; <i>35</i><br><i></i><br>ACT II &nbsp; THE PLAY, EDEN, AND THE FALL&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Chapter 8&nbsp; &nbsp; The Play <i>&nbsp; 39</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 9&nbsp; &nbsp; Eden &nbsp; <i>47</i><br><i>&nbsp; </i>Chapter 10&nbsp; The Fall &nbsp; <i>59</i><br><i></i><br>ACT III&nbsp; <i>EDUCATIO</i><br><i>&nbsp; </i>Chapter 11 &nbsp; Confusion &nbsp; <i>81</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 12 &nbsp; Opportunity &nbsp; <i>85</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 13 &nbsp; New York &nbsp; <i>91</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 14 &nbsp; Paradigm Shifts &nbsp; <i>95</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 15 &nbsp; The "Secrets" of the Masters &nbsp; <i>101</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 16 &nbsp; "Laws" of Music, Visualization, and other Discoveries &nbsp; <i>119</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 17 &nbsp; Skeletal, or Compositional, Thinking &nbsp; <i>163</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 18 &nbsp; Technique: A Three-Part System &nbsp; <i>187</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 19 &nbsp; Religion &nbsp; <i>217</i><br><i></i><br>ACT IV&nbsp; POWER AND IMPORTANCE<br>&nbsp; Chapter 20 &nbsp; Instruments and Violin Dealers &nbsp; <i>227</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 21 &nbsp; Mentors and the "Importance" of Importance &nbsp; <i>235</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 22 &nbsp; Conductors &nbsp; <i>247</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 23 &nbsp; Agents and Soloism &nbsp; <i>261</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 24 &nbsp; Composers &nbsp; <i>269</i><br><i></i><br>ACT V&nbsp; TEACHING--VALUES CREATE CULTURE &amp; POTENTIALITY<br>&nbsp; Chapter 25 &nbsp; The Suzuki Violin Method &nbsp; <i>277</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 26 &nbsp; Galamian &nbsp; <i>309</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 27 &nbsp; Responsibility &nbsp; <i>351</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 28 &nbsp; On "Feeling" in Music and Life &nbsp; <i>365</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 29 &nbsp; Altered States &nbsp; <i>371</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 30 &nbsp; The Development of Intelligence and Talent &nbsp; <i>383</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 31 &nbsp; Return to Curtis &nbsp; <i>403</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 32 &nbsp; Can We Change? &nbsp; <i>409</i><br>&nbsp; Chapter 33 &nbsp; Some Answers &nbsp; <i>417</i><br><i></i><br>Appendix &nbsp; <i>425&nbsp;</i><br>Sources &nbsp; <i>443</i><br><i><br></i><br><br><br><i><br></i><br><br><br><i></i><i>Lost Secrets of Master Musicians: A Window Into Genius </i>argues that:<br><br>There is a meta-pattern to music.&nbsp;<br><br>This pattern is discoverable.<br><br>Great players' technique and musical expression emerge from this meta-pattern (the ones studied in the book).<br><br>This may or may not have been a conscious alignment, but represents a gestalt shift in perception.<br><br>The field, and educational organs of classical music, as a whole, derive their teaching of technique and musical expression from analysis of the printed music.&nbsp;<br><br>Printed music is an abstraction of music. It's patterns are fundamentally opposite and <i>incommensurable</i> with the meta-pattern of music.<br><br>Fundamental mental (conceptual)/physical settings <i>determine</i> potential, both individually and systemically.<br><br>The great players studied in this book learned to play from printed music.<br><br>Yet, the mental/physical settings of these master musicians (the ones studied in this book) were <i>aligned to the meta-pattern of music</i>. Therefore, their concepts emerged from this bedrock reality of music. Physically, mentally and expressively they were in congruent relationship with their medium.&nbsp;<br><br>This psychological sympathy (and the <i>feedback</i> created by <i>congruence</i> with the meta-pattern of music) funneled--circumscribed--their action, <i>presenting </i>to them the possibility of technical wizardry and naturally expressive, inherently creative performance, evidencing in them what we would call "genius" or describe as "great talent."&nbsp;<br><br>The gestalt perceptual shifts made by these performers not only include an unconscious or conscious alignment with the meta-pattern of music, but several other <i>highly counter-intuitive </i>gestalt perceptual shifts regarding awareness of recursive patterns in physical motion and musical recursive patterning with the meta-pattern.<br><br>Implicit within these mental/physical structures is the capacity to generate complex musical patterns from a few <i>very simple mental/physical parameters and constraints.</i><br><br>Once known, these gestalt shifts, perceptual, physical, musical <i>can be taught</i>--practically applied to: playing technique in all instruments and voice, to teaching and performing.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Bel canto</i> singing <i>derives</i> from alignment to the meta-pattern, and was the <i>model</i> of musical declamation consciously studied by every great composer and instrumental performer.<br><br>Bel canto singers learned from music, but many did not.&nbsp;<br><br>How they made the above-mentioned perceptual shifts may constitute what Rossini describes as "the secrets of...traditions... If those who posses the great, true traditions disappear without leaving disciples on their level, the art vanishes, dies." (generational learning)<br><br>Speech declamation more closely approximates music's meta-pattern than does printed music.<br>a. Rhythm is derived from the rhythm of the body and speech pattern.<br>b. Playing or singing by ear does not necessarily align with music's meta-pattern.<br><br>Our current classical music paradigm is <i>incommensurable</i> with the meta-pattern of music and with "the secrets of those traditions."&nbsp;<br><br>Its foundational settings--educational paradigms, performance practices--are derived from the study of printed music <i>without the requisite gestalt shifts necessary for alignment with the meta-pattern.</i><br><br>This produces results <i>antagonistic to the actual nature of music</i>--to the meta-pattern.&nbsp;<br><br>This "false" alignment produces a fetish for perfectionism, a mechanical understanding and "re-creation" of the music, and a pedagogical structure at odds with the true nature of music. As a result of this, our current educational paradigm confuses and often destroys the efforts of serious students of music.<br><br>(Students are not only our future performers. They are our future audience. Their interest is to a great extent, as in any field, not separate from their success in learning.)<br><br>There is common agreement that interest in classical music is dwindling; that younger people are not interested in the genre and that the "new" music of contemporary composers is widely rejected by audiences.&nbsp;<br><br>Even though there are societal changes that may be negatively affecting the genre, educational factors are the <i>only </i>aspect of this problem over which musicians have any control.<br><br>These educative misunderstandings are serious enough to have a profoundly deleterious affect on the art form.&nbsp;<br><br>Because foundational settings circumscribe potential, creative energy for teaching, composing and performance in the classical music field would be significantly increased if aligned to the<i> meta-pattern of music.&nbsp;</i><br><br>Teaching music to students would be easier, enjoining creative playing as a natural part of learning and performance. The structure of performance (eventually ending the need for conductors in performance) would be reconfigured, opening possibilities for more creative approaches to public performance and composition.<br><br>These changes could stem the tide in a genre currently drifting into oblivion.</p><h2>Far Gone</h2><p>To save her only brother, Andrea Finch must face down a criminal mastermind, the FBI, and her own demons in this thrilling novel from the author of the bestselling Tracers series.<br><br>Police detective Andrea Finch is a rising star in her department until a split-second decision derails her career.

He was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, to Dena and Carl Schulz. His nickname &#34;Sparky&#34; was given by his uncle, after the horse Spark Plug in the Barney Google comic strip. He attended St. Paul&#39;s Richard Gordon Elementary School, where he skipped two half-grades. As a result, he was the youngest in his class when he attended St. Paul Central High years later, which may have been the reason why he was so shy and isolated as a young teenager. After his mother died in February, 1943, he was drafted into the army and sent to Camp Campbell in Kentucky. He was then shipped to Europe two years later to fight in World War II. After leaving the United States Army in 1945, he took a job as an art teacher at Art Instruction Inc., which he attended before he was drafted. First published by Robert Ripley in his Ripley&#39;s Believe It or Not!, then in a series of chronicles, The Saturday Evening Post, his first regular comic strip, Li&#39;l Folks was published in 1947 by the St. Paul Pioneer Press. (It was in this strip that Charlie Brown first appeared, as well as a dog that looked much like Snoopy). In 1950 he approached the United Features Syndicate with his best strips from Li&#39;l Folks, and Peanuts made its first appearance on October 2, 1950. This strip became one of the most popular comic strips of all time. He also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip called It&#39;s Only a Game (1957-1959), but abandoned that strip due to the demands of the success of Peanuts.</p><h2>Snow Walker</h2><p>Ten tales of the Arctic, rendering hardy praise to the land and its people, past and present, and focusing on the elemental bonds between men and between men and the world and on survival</p><p><b>Farley Mowat</b> was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1921, and grew up in Belleville, Trenton, Windsor, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Richmond Hill.

Tour.</p><p>The readers can&#39;t compensate for the unbearably pompous prose style of this extended parable about corporate politics and strategy. R.F.W. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineA sequel to Roberts's Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun (Warner, 1990. reprint), which was geared to individuals, this manual offers advice for organizational leaders. Like many "how to" books in management, it uses "how to win battles" as a metaphor for competing for markets and market share. "Chieftains who meet their own needs first--at the expense of the tribe--are worthless leaders," reads a typical entry. "Chieftains who hold on to power through a cunning mixture of deceit, brutality, and largesse are desperate despots. Huns do not follow them. Great warriors refuse to serve them." Even Attila the Hun knows there is nothing new under the sun--which is true of this work.

But he was scrappy and determined; in interviews he told potential managers that, &#x201c;Nobody can work harder than me. Nobody is willing to put in the hours I will put in. I am <i>insane</i>.&#x201d; As it turned out, on Wall Street insanity is not an undesirable quality. <br><br>Dillian rose from green associate, checking IDs at the entrance to the trading floor in the paranoid days following 9/11, to become an integral part of Lehman&#x2019;s culture in its final years as the firm&#x2019;s head Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) trader. More than $1 trillion in wealth passed through his hands, but at the cost of an untold number of smashed telephones and tape dispensers. Over time, the exhilarating and explosively stressful job took its toll on him. The extreme highs and lows of the trading floor masked and exacerbated the symptoms of Dillian&#x2019;s undiagnosed bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders, leading to a downward spiral that eventually landed him in a psychiatric ward. <br><br>Dillian put his life back together, returning to work healthier than ever before, but Lehman itself had seemingly gone mad, having made outrageous bets on commercial real estate, and was quickly headed for self-destruction. <br><br>A raucous account of the final years of Lehman Brothers, from 9/11 at its World Financial Center offices through the firm&#x2019;s bankruptcy, including vivid portraits of trading-floor culture, the financial meltdown, and the company&#x2019;s ultimate collapse, <i>Street Freak </i>is a raw, visceral, and wholly original memoir of life inside the belly of the beast during the most tumultuous time in financial history. In his electrifying and fresh voice, Dillian takes readers on a wild ride through madness and back, both inside Lehman Brothers and himself.</p><p>Jared Dillian<b> </b>is the founder of the subscription-based, daily financial market report <i>The Daily Dirtnap. </i>He worked on the Pacific Options Exchange from 1999 to 2000, and was a trader for Lehman Brothers from 2001 to 2008, specializing in index arbitrage and ETF trading.

It was there that I learned how the financial markets worked. I spent much of my time standing in the back of the Intel-Oracle pit with the other clerks and stock jockeys; that is, the area where traders in Intel and Oracle options congregated.<br> <br>There was a trader in the pit named Jack Taylor. Jack was six four, 240 pounds, with no concept of personal space. He spent half his day in a personal fast market, almost as though he was on crack, trading everything in sight: &#x201c;BUY YOUR BOOK, JAN 30 CALLS, 20 LOT! SELL YOUR BOOK, DEC 25 PUTS! SAGEOLA! SAGEAROONI!&#x201d; He was all arms and legs, thrashing his crumpled-up risk reports, crashing into other traders in the pit, eating lobster and steak burritos, passing gas all over the rest of the crowd, and heading out back to have sex with one of the female exchange clerks behind the Dumpster.<br> <br>I wanted to be like Jack.<br> <br>I wanted to be like Jack because he seemed to be one of God&#x2019;s simplest and most beautiful creations. Make money, good. Lose money, bad. Burrito, good. Hangover, bad. My life seemed terribly complicated, and if I could boil down my existence to this primordial level, then it would be an existentially freeing experience.<br> <br>But I was wrong. Jack&#x2019;s wild personality was a smoke screen, a defense mechanism that he had created to convince other people (and perhaps himself, too) that his life really was that uncomplicated. He was not a simple guy but a rather complex one: a smart kid who had graduated from an Ivy League school, who had made deliberate and rational choices about what to do with his life, and who was now having second thoughts. His acting out was his way of coping, his way of distracting himself from the reality that the financial markets are a cruel way to make a living.<br> <br>Jack now owns a sandwich shop in Chicago: Jack&#x2019;s Sandos.<br> <br>All traders go through what Jack went through. They learn to cope with the idea that they are expendable. If you ever take a trip to an investment bank&#x2019;s trading floor, look around. Try to find the rare and elusive silver fox. Try to count the number of traders over forty. You won&#x2019;t find many.<br> <br>Partly this is because of mathematics. If the markets are mostly a zero-sum game, then the winners stick around and the losers find other things to do with their lives. The likelihood of somebody lasting ten years is only about one in five hundred.<br> <br>The bigger reason that you don&#x2019;t see old farts on trading floors is because people self-select. After a number of years in the business, they say enough is enough, hand in their company ID, and they go raise alpacas outside of Spokane.<br> <br>The important detail is that all traders are capitalists of one stripe or another. Some of them are even supercapitalists, staunch libertarians, politically well to the right of even the Republican Party. And capitalism requires a dedication to the pursuit of reality. A rock is a rock is a rock. A rock is not a tree, no matter what mental gymnastics you perform. Profits are profits. Losses are losses. And there is no <i>evading</i> losses. You see your P&amp;L every day, and the negative number stares you in the face.<br> <br>Back in the civilian world, people permit themselves to evade reality. If the market is down, they won&#x2019;t open the brokerage statement. They will stop investing. They will give up. They will <i>hope</i> that things come back.<br> <br>Being a professional trader allows no such evasion. Hope is not a strategy. If you have a loss, you had better figure it out, or you are out on your ass.<br> <br>That is a hell of a way to live.<br> <br>But only if you can get to work in the morning. Seven years of this.<br> <br> <i>I&#x2019;m late. Again. Did I lock the front door?</i> <br> <br>If you&#x2019;re a trader, it is important to exercise the illusion of control, because the reality is that you&#x2019;re not in control of anything. The smartest man on Wall Street, after months and months of research on a single trade, has no control over the outcome. In the short term, his position can move against him and force him to liquidate the world&#x2019;s best idea, only to make him watch as it appreciates 200 percent over the next six months.<br> <br><i>I definitely turned the coffeemaker off. But I&#x2019;m not sure I locked the front door</i>.<br> <br>Traders deal with probabilities. There is a probability distribution for interest rates, for the log return of stock prices, and for cheating on your spouse without getting caught. The world is filled with uncertainty, and you try to model it. You quantify it. I model the likelihood that someone will break into my house if I forget to lock the door, and I determine that it is infinitesimally small. But not small enough.<br> <br><i>I&#x2019;d better turn around and check the front door</i>.<br> <br>It is true that in the absence of trade, there is war. But trade is just a different kind of warfare: buyers continually demand lower prices, and sellers want more for what they&#x2019;re selling. A transaction occurs when&#x2014;for a brief moment in time&#x2014;buyer and seller can agree on a price. You&#x2019;d think that both parties would be satisfied at this point, but in practice, they&#x2019;re more pissed off at each other than they were before. Everyone thinks he&#x2019;s getting screwed. A trading floor is filled with unhappy people, because nobody is ever satisfied.<br> <br><i>Okay. Here we go</i>.<br> <br>Unlock, unlock.<br> <br>Step outside. Turn around.<br> <br>Lock dead bolt. Test doorknob. Push against door. <i>Feel</i> that it&#x2019;s locked.<br> <br>Lock doorknob.<br> <br>Lock dead bolt again. <i>Five, four, three, two, one</i>.<br> <br>Lock door again. <i>Five, four, three, two, one</i>.<br> <br>Lock dead bolt again. <i>Three, two, one</i>.<br> <br>Lock door again. <i>Three, two, one</i>.<br> <br>Lock dead bolt again.<br> <br>Lock door again.<br> <br>Jiggle doorknob. Locked. <i>Five, three, one. Five, three, one</i>.<br> <br>In most of the world&#x2019;s markets, prices are sticky. The price of milk does not change on a second-by-second basis. It does not <i>tick</i>. Neither do the prices of air conditioners, coffeemakers, or MP3s. But a share of GE stock is worth more than it was just a second ago. In the financial markets, quoted prices are good for an instant; after that, they&#x2019;re stale. Numbers change, and there are consequences. People start yelling. In fact, traders yell all the time. Sometimes it&#x2019;s because they&#x2019;re angry with you, but mostly it is to convey a sense of urgency. <i>Five bid for ten thousand, immediate. Higher, now!</i> I&#x2019;ve seen kids out of college who were completely unprepared for the brutality of trading. Someone yells, and they crumble. They literally shake. Trading is not for the weak, the indecisive, the passive, or the homeschooled.<br> <br><i>Damn it</i>.<br> <br>Back to the house, all the way from the bus stop.<br> <br><i>Forgot to check the refrigerator</i>.<br> <br> <i>This is madness. The madness. It&#x2019;s back again, isn&#x2019;t it?</i> <br> <br>Intimidation, I found, works pretty well, but only to a point. It can get you the extra penny, the balance of the order, and the price adjustment. But it is not a necessary or even sufficient condition for success. There is the guy in the pit with the glasses that nobody pays attention to. He buys when other people are selling. He steps aside when a big order comes through. He&#x2019;s cordial. He keeps up appearances, but it is impossible to tell if he is having a good day or a bad day. It is impossible to tell if he is having a good year or a bad year.<br> <br>He is having a very good year. He is up $3 million.<br> <br><i>The refrigerator&#x2019;s closed</i>.<br> <br>Back upstairs.<br> <br><i>I can&#x2019;t stand this</i>.<br> <br>Windows. Bathroom windows, office windows, bedroom windows.<br> <br>Computer off, printer off.<br> <br><i>Concentrate</i>.<br> <br>Coffeemaker off. Lights off.<br> <br>Porch windows.<br> <br><i>Ready</i>.<br> <br>It is more important to be smart than it is to be big, or fast, or a jerk. And on Wall Street, there are all kinds of smart. There are mathematicians, people who can find the flaws in Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning options pricing models. There are computer geeks. There are poker players. There are the social psychologists, like me, who know that human behavior runs in patterns over time. Any or all of them can get rich. The people who don&#x2019;t are the people who don&#x2019;t ask questions, the people who consider it a birthright to act as a tollbooth attendant, taking their nickel from the market, not a care in the world.<br> <br><i>Different pattern this time. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one</i>.<br> <br>Lock door.<br> <br>Lock dead bolt.<br> <br>Jiggle doorknob. Locked. <i>Nine, five, one. Nine, five, one</i>.<br> <br><i>Remember that. And catch your bus</i>.<br> <br><i>This is a choice. You can choose not to do this</i>.<br> <br>There are those who think it is terribly unproductive to have an entire class of people dedicated to buying and selling money. They say that buying and selling money doesn&#x2019;t actually produce anything. It&#x2019;s just moving wealth around from one pile to the next. Even if that were true, it doesn&#x2019;t mean that anyone should care: to most people, making money is an end in itself. There are those, however, who spend their entire career on Wall Street and can&#x2019;t explain what it is they do for a living when they go home to their children at night. They&#x2019;re embarrassed for themselves, because they feel that they&#x2019;re not a force for good in the world.<br> <br>To me, making money was an end in itself. But beyond that, it is important for any economy to have deep, liquid capital markets. Lost in the debate about the credit crisis&#x2014;about whether or not it was good for banks to be lending money to people who would have great difficulty paying it back&#x2014;is the concept that these people, for the first time, had <i>access</i> to capital. Without the existence of capital markets, without people like me and Jack Taylor, none of the dot-com companies, even the so-called good ones, like Amazon, would have been able to raise capital on such attractive terms. The same can be said for just about every bubble, every capital markets phenomenon. In markets, people make mistakes. But for every mistake made, someone, somewhere, benefits.<br> <br> <i>Did I lock the door?</i> <br> <br><i>You locked the door. You did nine-five-one</i>.<br> <br><i>I can remember doing nine-five-one, but I can&#x2019;t remember locking the door</i>.<br> <br><i>So get off the bus</i>.<br> <br>Being a trader, to me, meant that for the first time in my life, I was looking out for myself. Me looking out for myself was a good thing. Because I was looking out for myself, because I sought to buy low and sell high, good things were happening in the world. A money manager was able to sell something at an inflated price, and his clients&#x2014;dentists and teachers and bus drivers&#x2014;all benefited. But I didn&#x2019;t care. I just wanted to get paid.<br> <br>This came with a price.<br> <br>For most people, it is their sanity. Go to a casino late at night and observe. Money at risk brings out the worst in human behavior. There is the plainly shitfaced man in his fifties who is betting $2,000 on a single hand of blackjack, ignoring his wife&#x2019;s calls, the phone vibrating incessantly in his pocket. There are the prostitutes. There are the counters, also known as the &#x201c;advantage&#x201d; players. All of these creatures exist in the capital markets in one form or another. Their behavior is excusable when there is money at stake. But it makes for a short career.<br> <br><i>Again</i>.<br> <br>Back windows. Front windows.<br> <br>Coffeemaker off. Lights off.<br> <br>Porch windows.<br> <br><i>This is going to be it. I&#x2019;m not coming back again</i>.<br> <br><i>Plastic utensils and Velcro shower curtains are in your future if you keep this up</i>.<br> <br>I would be the exception, I thought. I was perfectly suited to trading. A former military officer and math whiz, thoughtful yet aggressive, intellectual yet vulgar, I could survive&#x2014;no, thrive&#x2014;in any trading environment. I remembered prices like they were yesterday. I saw patterns. And I was brutal enough to fight for the last penny. I wasn&#x2019;t going to be one of those guys who bailed out after a few years and went to something soft and forgiving, like consulting. I wasn&#x2019;t going to leave the business and write a book about how awful Wall Street was. Pussies.<br> <br>I walked through life knowing that what I was doing was right. My insides matched my outsides. There is nothing so precious in this world as a man who is in the right place at the right time; who knows that he is doing what he is meant to be doing; who knows that if God exists, He placed him here on this earth to be a trader.<br> <br><i>Oh no</i>.<br> <br>On the bus. Almost in the tunnel now.<br> <br><i>Not again</i>.<br> <br>But take a hundred people and put them in separate rooms, each with a computer terminal and no windows, and allow them to trade futures. Give them each a million dollars. Don&#x2019;t let them come out for a week. Ninety of them will lose everything. Nine of them will manage to break even, maybe making a few hundred thousand dollars in the process. One of them will get rich.<br> <br>All of them will go insane trying.<br> <br><i>I thought this was supposed to get better. I thought this was supposed to go away</i>.<br> <br>I had gone mad trying. But then, everyone goes mad trying. Lehman Brothers was too small to be an investment bank and too large to be an insane asylum. The difference between me and everyone else was that I was man enough to admit it.<br> <br>Off the bus and running down the street, back to the house.<br> <br><i>Just tell yourself you&#x2019;re being crazy.

His big breakthrough in American comics came in 2005 illustrating and designing the critically acclaimed series DMZ, an intense modern-day war story, written by Brian Wood.Starred Review. In the aftermath of a massive civilian slaughter by America's own troops, journalist Matty Roth desperately searches for answers and accountability in this hauntingly grim but surprisingly poignant war story. The five-issue collection, continuing to expand upon the intriguing premise of a demilitarized Manhattan resulting from the civil war between the U.S. Government and Free State rebels, showcases numerous conflicting accounts of the infamous Day 204 Massacre. The story is eerily astute in its portrayal of the fog of war, particularly the unavoidably deadly consequences of poorly planned operations in an urban combat theater. Despite Matty's and the reader's genuine desire for justice, or even just some answers, the conclusion is smartly complex and anticlimactic, and therefore heartbreakingly believable. The writing and artwork, by regular artist Burchielli and a variety of guests, is well paired, the gritty images bringing to life a dark, lonely yet claustrophobic cityscape, where a pointless death is only an exploding building or angry mob away. The book expertly explores the intricacies of death and responsibility in combat, and the tragic nature of people who are forced to turn on their own. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He&#x2019;d done this once before, more than thirty years earlier in 1963, fleeing a crumbling marriage and bringing along Gustav, his eighteen-year-old son, pitching this audacious, potentially fatal scheme&#x2014;winter already coming on, in these woods, on these waters&#x2014;as a reenactment of the ancient voyageurs&#x2019; journeys of discovery. <br><br>It&#x2019;s certainly something Gus has never forgotten, nor the Devil&#x2019;s Maw of a river, a variety of beloved (possibly fantastical) maps, the ice floes and waterfalls (neither especially appealing from a canoe), a magnificent bear, the endless portages, a magical abandoned shack, Thanksgiving and Christmas improvised at the far end of the earth, the brutal cold and sheer beauty of it all. And men hunting other men. <br><br>Now&#x2014;with his father pronounced dead&#x2014;Gus relates their adventure in vivid detail to Berit Lovig, who&#x2019;d spent much of her life waiting for Harry, her passionate conviction finally fulfilled over the last two decades. So, a middle-aged man rectifying his personal history, an aging lady wrestling with her own, and with the entire saga of a town and region they&#x2019;d helped to form and were in turn formed by, relentlessly and unforgettably.</p><p><b>PETER GEYE</b>&nbsp;was born and raised in Minneapolis, where he continues to live. His previous novels are <i>Safe from the Sea</i> and <i>The Lighthouse Road</i>.Our winters are faithful and unfailing and we take what they bring, but this season has tested even the most devout among us. The thermometer hanging outside my window reads thirty-�two degrees below zero. Five degrees warmer than yesterday, which itself was warmer than the day before. I can hear the pines exploding, heartwood turned to splinter and pulp all up and down the Burnt Wood River.<br><br>As if the cold weren&#x2019;t enough, yesterday brought another unkindness. Gustav Eide came bearing it: his father&#x2019;s red woolen hat&#x2014;�the one he wore almost every day, the type children wear tobogganing&#x2014;�found by those Bargaard twins as they ice-�skated out past the breakwater.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time Gus came knocking this winter. Back in November he held his own hat in his hands. Gus, with his father&#x2019;s lonesome, lazy eyes, standing bareheaded but buttoned up outside my door.<br><br>&#x201c;I hate to drop in unannounced, Berit,&#x201d; he had said then.<br><br>&#x201c;Since when do we stand on ceremony around here? Come in.&#x201d;<br><br>He stepped inside but stood with his back against the door, his eyes studying his bootlaces. I&#x2019;ve seen much of this town&#x2019;s woe, its suffering and tragedy, and have marked it all. While I stood there waiting for Gus to speak, I knew my own everlasting sadness was suddenly upon me.<br><br>&#x201c;He disappeared last night, Berit.&#x201d; He spoke without looking up. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>I turned and stepped carefully to the bench under the window and sat.<br><br>&#x201c;We found tracks heading up the river,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>I looked up at him, now looking down at me. I thought of sitting at his father&#x2019;s bedside the evening before, holding his hand, singing to him. I thought of how Harry had looked at me, his gaze seeming to go through me and into some past only he could see. I was disappearing from his view. This I knew.<br><br>Gus came and sat next to me on the bench. &#x201c;That new sheriff&#x2014;�Ruutu&#x2019;s his name&#x2014;�is leading the search. We went all the way up past the lower falls. The dogs lost his scent around the Devil&#x2019;s Maw. Ruutu&#x2019;s down in Gunflint right now, calling for more help.&#x201d;<br><br>He reached over and held my hand, a gesture he surely learned from his father and one that calmed me down, at once familiar and uncanny. There are depths to those Eides no sounding line will ever reach. I knew this about Harry and I have come to know it about Gus, though on that November morning he knew me much better than I did him.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not going to find him, Berit.&#x201d;<br><br>He let my hand go and sat back and rubbed the cold from his cheeks.<br><br>&#x201c;Why would you say that? He can&#x2019;t have gone far,&#x201d; I said, thinking again of that faraway look in Harry&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve heard this story before, haven&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Speak plainly, would you? For the benefit of an old lady?&#x201d;<br><br>Then Gus looked through me just as his father had only hours before. &#x201c;People searched for don&#x2019;t get found here. Not in these woods.&#x201d; He closed his eyes and shook his head as though to banish some thought. &#x201c;Put on some coffee? I&#x2019;ll tell you how all this happened.&#x201d;<br><br>So I did. I went to the kitchen and filled the kettle at the sink. As the water poured from the faucet I glanced upriver, where I have kept my eyes more or less since. Two stories began that day in November. One of them was new and the other as old as this land itself. Both of them were borne by the river.<br><br>Ruutu and his deputies and Gus and his sister, Signe, and the good people of Gunflint spent a week searching for Harry, every dawn following some new dead end into the wilderness, every dusk emerging from wherever they&#x2019;d been, tired and cold and no closer to finding him. Gus stopped by each evening to tell me where they&#x2019;d looked, assuring me every single time they&#x2019;d never find him. Even still, the next morning he went out with the others. Sometimes three or four parties, following three or four leads. When, finally, they conceded Harry to the wilderness, it was thanks to Gus&#x2019;s insistence. Signe went back home to Minneapolis. Gus back to his job teaching English and history at Arrowhead High School. Ruutu back to our local misdemeanors and traffic violations.<br><br>Me? I was still searching in my own fashion. That first morning, I visited Harry&#x2019;s empty bed. There was the iron headboard and the flannel linens and the quilt crumpled at the foot of the bed. Harry was always too warm. The pillow still held the imprint of his head. His medication sat on the bedside table, next to the radio and a half-�drunk glass of water. The bureau opposite the bedside table was as old and timeworn as whatever part of Harry stored his memories. I crossed the room and opened the top drawer and noticed straightaway his knit hat was missing. Strangely, the pompom had been snipped off.<br><br>I&#x2019;d passed the previous evening as I had so many others before it, sitting at his bedside, reminding him of who we used to be, feeling at times that I was not only disappearing into the darkness of his mind but from the world altogether. It was no less strange that evening than it had been at the start of his confinement to see a man still so bodily strong becoming a child again. No less strange and no less unbearable.<br><br>Of that last night we spent together, I cannot say he exhibited any signs he was about to undertake a disappearance, no word spoken or gesture made that gave me pause. He did nothing that might&#x2019;ve forewarned me. That evening I only hoped, as I did every night, that when he finally fell to sleep he would do so with the knowledge of my love, and that when he dreamt it would be of peaceful things.<br><br>It was Doctor Ingebrigsten&#x2014;�who grew up in Misquah, went to medical school in Minneapolis, and returned to Arrowhead County because, she said, this place needed one of its own to care for its sickly&#x2014;�who described to Gus and me what it would become like for Harry. &#x201c;You and I,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;we see our past as though it were a bright summer day. The trees green, flowers blossoming, the water shining blue. Harry&#x2019;s going to start seeing less and less of his past until&#x2014;�sadly&#x2014;�everything will seem as though it&#x2019;s taking place in a nighttime blizzard in the dead of winter.&#x201d; She said this on a September morning, with the trees in full autumn blaze&#x2014;�our loveliest time of year&#x2014;�and I wept to think that the man I loved would never register that beauty again, even if he lived another ten years.<br><br>That same morning Doctor Ingebrigsten told me the best thing I could do for Harry was to be with him. Sit at his bedside and talk to him and tell him I still loved him. To hold him among us for as long as I could. So I did. Of course I did.<br><br>And now it&#x2019;s been half of a winter since Harry vanished, and I can finally rest my thoughts. I ought to feel relief. Of this I&#x2019;m sure. But do you know what it&#x2019;s like to hold proof of the last heartache you&#x2019;ll ever know in your own raw hands? I hadn&#x2019;t known, either, not until Gus delivered Harry&#x2019;s red hat yesterday morning, a cork bobber sewed on where the pompom should&#x2019;ve been. Gus&#x2019;s stories and that damn hat&#x2014;�handed to me like a verdict and never spoken of again&#x2014;�these things have made of my heart what this season has of the splintering pines along the river.</p><h2>Star Trek Volume 1</h2><p><ul> <li>The adventures of the <i>Starship Enterprise</i> continue in this new story that picks up where the blockbuster 2009 film left off!

Whether creating flower arrangements for state occasions at the White House or nosegays for an intimate wedding, MSdderlake's approach was always simple, natural, and unexpected. And in <i>Flowers Rediscovered,</i> Tom Pritchard and Billy Jarecki, the creative founders of MSdderlake, share their ideas, sources, and secrets so that we can create our own inspired flower arrangements.<p><i>Flowers Rediscovered,</i> now available in a revised paperback edition with more informative captions, inspires us to take a fresh look at the possibilities for using and enjoying flowers. MSdderlake asks us to consider the materials at hand--poppies and larkspur from the garden, squash and strawberry flowers from the market, black-eyed Susans from the field--as well as the rare and delicate blossoms a florist can provide. The provocative, often passionate text also offers dozens of creative ideas for containers, as well as tips for cutting, conditioning, and pruning flowers. More than 175 witty photographs by leading still-life photographers explore not only the character of flowers individually and in groupings, but also the relationship of flowers to their containers, to their settings, and to the mood or occasion.</p><p> As Tom Pritchard urges in <i>Flowers Rediscovered,</i> "Learn to value flowers and treasure the joy and lessons they afford. If they are worthy messengers, their presence can bring simple beauty to our surroundings, brighten our days, help to remind us of the natural world that often seems far away. Look for the flowers that can actually do all these things and leave the less capable ones behind. The time has come to grow."</p><p></p><p></p></p><p>When Pritchard and Jarecki (aka M&#x201e;dderlake) write about flowers, it is with a gusto that acknowledges the myriad ways in which flowers can embellish daily life. Their New York shop has been innovative in introducing refreshing approaches to floral design, often characterized by imaginative elements that could easily be overlooked. There might be subtly decorative branches gathered from winter bushes, or flowers that rapidly peak and fade. Advice is practical but with a refreshing zeal that is contagious, and the floral arrangements tend toward an exuberant, naturalistic form. Nearly 200 color photographs illustrating these exuberant displays of flowers. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Sigmund Freud (Bloom&#39;s Modern Critical Views)</h2><p>Sigmund Freud's theories changed forever the way we see our actions and ourselves.

Standing united against a common enemy, they will summon from ancient sources a power in desperately short supply in modern Brooklyn-a force that&#39;s forgotten by most of the world but is known to believers as magic.</p><p>In 1940s Brooklyn, friendship between an 11-year-old Irish Catholic boy and an elderly Jewish rabbi might seem as unlikely as, well, snow in August. But the relationship between young Michael Devlin and Rabbi Judah Hirsch is only one of the many miracles large and small contained in Pete Hamill's novel. Michael finds himself in trouble when he witnesses the 17-year-old leader of the dreaded Falcons gang beating an elderly shopkeeper. For Michael, 1940s Brooklyn is a world still shaped by life in the Old Country, a world where informing on a fellow Irishman is the worst crime imaginable--worse even than the violent crimes committed by some of those fellows. So Michael keeps silent, finding solace in the company of Rabbi Hirsch, a Czech refuge whom he meets by chance. From this serendipitous beginning blossoms a unique friendship--one that proves perilous to both when the Falcons catch up with them. <p> Interlaced with Hamill's realistic descriptions of violence and fear are scenes of remarkable poignancy: the rabbi's first baseball game, where he sees Jackie Robinson play for the Dodgers; Michael's introduction into the mystical world of the Cabbala and the book's miraculous ending. Hamill is not a lyrical writer, but he is a heartfelt one, and this story of courage in the face of great odds is one of his best.</p>Pete Hamill is a novelist, essayist and journalist whose career has endured for more than forty years. He was born in Brooklyn, N. Y. in 1935, the oldest of seven children of immigrants from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He attended Catholic schools as a child.

He witnessed the events of September 11, 2001 and its aftermath and wrote about them for the Daily News. At the same time, Hamill has written much fiction, including movie and TV scripts. He has published nine novels and two collections of short stories. His 1997 novel, Snow in August, was on the New York Times bestseller list for four months. His memoir, A Drinking Life, was on the same New York Times list for 13 weeks.

His latest novel, Forever, was published by Little, Brown in January 2003 and became a New York Times bestseller.

This book was written by an eight year old girl some time around the turn of the century. It is a story of courtship. The author had read many of the clasic novels on the subject. Combined with the experiences of a child, the result is a book filled with unintentional humor. The result is that her characters are at once children and adults. When taken for a ride in a carriage, her heroin kneels on her trunk and looks out the window, bouncing up and down in her excitement. When Mr. Salteena, whose ambition it is to be a &#34;real gentleman,&#34; is presented at court the Prince of Whales offers him ice cream. When he goes to visit London, Mr. Salteena sees nothing improper about sending the heroin to stay with the hero, chaperoned. They fall in love and marry, much to the disappointment of Mr. Salteena who loves her too. He consoles himself by eating some of the wonderful deserts at their wedding supper. This is one of the funniest books ever written.</p><p></p><h2>Some Questions about Language: A Theory of Human Discourse and Its Objects</h2><p><p>How do meaningless marks and sounds become the meaningful words of a natural language? To what do words having referential significance refer? What is the meaning of the words that do not have referential significance? Can ordinary language really do what it appears to do, or is this an illusion? Dr. Adler maintains that these fundamental questions are not satisfactorily treated in the two main philosophies of language that have dominated twentieth-century thinking on the subject - the syntactical and 'ordinary language' approaches.<br> <br> Drawing upon the tradition of Aristotle, Aquinas, Poinsot, and Husserl, Dr. Adler's own discussion exemplifies the third approach, which he describes as "semantic and lexical." In this now -classic work, the fruit of more than 50 years' concern with the philosophy of language, Dr. Adler advances a powerful theory of meaning and applies it to some outstanding philosophical problems. In unpretentious and uncluttered prose, he provides a limpid introduction to a number of knotty philosophical issues and at the same time issues a challenge to some of the most tenacious doctrines of the modern world.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Service of the Sword (Worlds of Honor #4)</h2><p>Some of the science fiction genre&#39;s leading writers--including David Weber, John Ringo, Eric Flint, and Timothy Zahn--chronicle the continuing adventures and exploits of daring starship commander Honor Harrington, in a new action-packed anthology.</p><p>David Weber is a science fiction phenomenon. His popular Honor Harrington space-opera adventures are &#34;New York Times&#34; bestsellers and can&#39;t come out fast enough for his devoted readers. Weber and his wife Sharon live in South Carolina.In the fourth World of Honor volume, other military sf specialists visit the universe Weber created for female astronaut Honor Harrington. In the title story, Weber places Honor, the first midshipwoman graduated from Grayson, the astronautical academy, aboard her first Manticoran warship and has her win out in a situation for which she wasn't trained. Jane Lindskjold's contribution confronts Manticoran royalty with female refugees from a planet whose sexism beggars the word <i>barbaric</i>. In Timothy Zahn's "With One Stone," the kind of futuristic thriller of which he is a master, Honor isn't the only one who can detect a booby trap and detonate it safely. John Ringo contributes twice, collaboratively with Victor Mitchell in "A Ship Named Francis" and solo in "Let's Go to Prague"; light but not frivolous, these stories show his flair for military absurdity. Finally, in "The Fanatic," the semi-ubiquitous Eric Flint thinks and writes well about secret policemen and their possibilities. If Honor's audience hasn't yet expanded beyond its military sf core, this book should make it do so. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The source of this rather melodramatic approach to the art and craft of writing was a life that encompassed the whaling era and the Civil War and included time spent in Polynesia, where he was flogged, fled from cannibals, joined a mutiny, and frolicked with naked islanders. The result was a body of work that ranged from popular fiction (<i>Typee</i>) to the dreadful gothic romance (<i>Pierre</i>) to the classic <i>Moby Dick</i>. Working with 500 family letters found in 1983, Laurie Robertson-Lorant provides a compelling, multifaceted portrait of one of America's most intriguing literary figures.Laurie Robertson-Lorant teaches at St. Mark&#39;s School in Southborough, Massachusetts.</p><h2>Greek Love Reconsidered</h2><p>Was the Ancient Greek practice of pederasty a rite of pedagogical mentorship and initiation into adulthood, as the Greeks themselves supposed, or exploitation of the vulnerable and weak by the powerful, as some critics have argued? <p>Four respected scholars discuss the institution from different perspectives, with a view to reconstructing the Greeks' own attitudes toward pederasty in their full complexity and chronological evolution. </p><p>* Thomas K.

There was not a breath of air, and the black asphalt was sticky and melting as it gave way to the afternoon heat. It radiated up into his face like a blast furnace. He wouldn't be here, using a pay phone, except that he was out of town and this was one call that absolutely had to go through an operator.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Over the years he had placed collect calls back home many times, but this one was entirely different. This time, he instructed the operator to be sure to emphasize that the call was from "doctor," rather than "mister." How strange it sounded to hear her say "doctor" in front of his name when his father answered at the other end. It was "Dr. Son" calling "Dr. Dad," an achievement that had been so very long and hard in coming. Eleven years, to be exact. Three hundred hours of college credit, tens of thousands of pages read and studied, and hundreds and hundreds of all-nighters in preparation for nearly as many tests and exams. There had been miles and miles of long walks from the remote parking lots at the hospital, where students, interns, and residents were "dog meat." More recently, it had been month after month of enduring the inescapable, acrid smell of Thorazine-laced urine on the psychiatric wards of the VA hospital -- some might say warehouse -- where he had spent long days and longer nights "treating" (storing) the inpatients on those cold and desolate wards.</p><p></p><p></p><p>No less painfully, there had been the days, weeks, and months of dealing with a variety of insecure, "emotionally interesting" professors, many of them white-coated Napoleons who were all too eager to wield the power of their petty fiefdoms. Their torments had culminated in that unforgettable final year, when he had walked the halls at school and put in his time at the hospital, armed with a signed letter of resignation on his clipboard, daring just one more anal-retentive, power-hungry mentor-turned-tormentor to say so much as "boo" to him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In spite of it all, and as surprised as anyone who knew him, here he stood. He remembered one of his favorite profs telling him he would never make it because he had an "attitude" and refused to "kiss ass." He was told, "You have too many options in your life to put up with this fiasco of dysfunction, you aren't near desperate enough to tolerate the abuse!" Yet here he was. One by one, the department heads had signed off on his final requirements, shaken his hand, and congratulated him on earning the highest degree in his profession. Doctor -- wow! He knew how proud his dad was going to be. This phone call would be a huge step closer to a father's dream come true: father and son, both doctors, practicing together, side by side!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Throughout the long ordeal, he had been powerfully influenced by his knowledge of his father's vision and dream. Theirs was a family of meager and simple beginnings. In fact, the young doctor and his father were the only ones from either side of the extended family ever to go to college, let alone earn doctoral degrees. Surely, then, this phone call was to be a proud moment indeed. The long journey was over. Victory was at hand, and parents and family were bursting with pride.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was all cued up just right. Ready and waiting for him was a thriving practice, all set to explode with the energy and inspiration he would bring. That meant no more scrounging for money for him and his young wife. No more driving cars that were beyond old. No more living in apartments so small you had to go outside to turn around. Most importantly, the young doctor truly did care about helping people, and here was his chance to do just that. So there couldn't be anything wrong with any of this. Right?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Yet standing in that parking lot, mouthing the words of expected excitement -- even as he heard his father's voice breaking with unmistakable pride -- he looked over at his wife waiting in the car. There sat the only person in the entire world who knew him well enough to know that something was wrong. How could everything be so right, yet feel so wrong? He looked into her eyes. Without speaking a word, he knew that she knew.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But he would play the good soldier. He would shrug off the negative feelings and forge ahead. Soon he would be scrambling so fast that life would crowd out the nagging thoughts, and he would focus instead on meeting the expectations held by so many who loved him. He told himself it was probably just anxiety anyway, nothing a little hard work won't take care of. So with a healthy dose of dutiful self-righteousness, a work-your-butt-off commitment, and a na�vet� that can only come from being young and stupid, he prepared to go to work. There were those doubts, and there was that vague uneasiness about the road he had started down. That nagging sense that something just wasn't quite right continued. But hey, he was going to make a lot of people really proud.</p><p></p><p></p><p>At the same time, he made a heartfelt promise to himself: <b>I don't care how much money I get to making -- If I ever find myself doing this just for the money, if I am ever just going through the motions, I am out of here. I will turn on my heels and walk smooth away. I will never sell out and live without passion and fire just because it is secure, expected, or easy! I'm no one-trick pony. If I can succeed at this, I could succeed at a lot of things just as well, no problem.</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>Ten years later...</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ten years and thousands of patients later, the not-so-young, not-so-stupid, and not-nearly-so-na�ve doctor and his wife step off of a client's private jet at a busy airport in the heart of a teeming, fast-paced city. It is a crisp and beautiful Sunday afternoon in October. His practice has exploded to perhaps the largest in the country. He has mastered his profession. Successful? Yes, certainly by any standard he knows of. A secure lifestyle? Without a doubt. Houses and cars? Only the best. Two great children, a wonderful marriage, and proud parents: he has it all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So why doesn't it feel any more right than it did ten years ago, standing at the pay phone in that hot, deserted parking lot? His self-righteous declaration of ten years ago haunts him more and more. He has often wished he had never said it. There are those dreadful times when "the truth" runs faster than he can. It is particularly bad when he is really tired, or in those rare moments when he has allowed himself to become very still. He has hated those times, because it is then that his private reality mocks him: <b>If I ever find myself doing this just for the money...if I am ever just going through the motions, I am out of here. I will never sell out. I will never live without passion and fire just because it is secure, expected, or easy....</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>The promise haunts him, because he knows that money and lifestyle have in fact "bought him," just as he swore they would not. Far from being vitally involved in his own life, he feels trapped by it. There is a part of him that remembers what it was like to have passion, hope, optimism, and energy. It is a part that has refused to succumb to and accept the roles assigned by an insensitive and sometimes hurtful world. It is a part of his concept of self that just wants to get in the game, the game <i>he</i> wants to play: a game that means something to him, whether it means anything to anyone else or not. It is a private, usually denied, part of himself that does not want to be controlled by what is expected. It is a part of him that knows what is genuine, yet it is a part that usually lives in silence.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The simple truth is that he is not living a life that he wants, or that he chose. He is living a life that pleases a lot of people, most of them well intended, but not him. He is doing what he does, simply because it is what his father did. He is even living in a place he did not consciously choose. In fact, it is the last place on earth he would have ever chosen. He has a life many would love, but his heart is not in it. It is not natural for him, so he has to do what he does by brute force: Everything is a chore. There is no passion; there is no excitement. He ignores his real dreams, but doing so is hard and getting harder. Being someone and something he is not is the hardest thing he has ever done.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Clearly, this is not some monumental tragedy. I mean, come on: "Poor baby has to work in a cushy office all day!" It is not the kind of cause c�l�bre that makes the evening news. Could he "get happy"? After all, his marriage and family are great. Could he be satisfied with that and just keep on keeping on? Yes. But it gets harder with every day that passes, days that have turned into weeks, months, and years. He sometimes hears a voice, his own voice, crying for relief, but he does not react. Sometimes it is just easier not to think about it. After all, does <i>feeling</i> right, does <i>having passion&lt;...</i></p></p><h2>The Complete Guide to Stamps &amp; Stamp Collecting: The ultimate illustrated reference to over 3000 of the world's best stamps, and a professional guide ... and perfecting a spectacular collection</h2><p>A full-colour directory of the world&#39;s greatest stamps, including photographs over 3000 stamps from more than 200 countries</p><p>Dr James Mackay was one of the foremost and most prolific authors on stamps and stamp collecting in the world.

Robert Oppenheimer became the most famous scientist of his generation. One of the iconic figures of the 20th century and the embodiment of modern scientific man&#39;s Faustian compact, Oppenheimer confronted the moral consequences of scientific progress. Already a notable young physicist before WWII, during the race to split the atom, &#39;Oppie&#39; galvanized an extraordinary team of international scientists while keeping the FBI at bay.Years later, haunted by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer became a staunch opponent of plans to develop the hydrogen bomb. It was a battle he was to lose, faced by powerful advocates for massive nuclear profusion. In response, the US Atomic Energy Commission and the FBI worked behind the scenes to have a hearing find that Oppenheimer could not be trusted with America&#39;s nuclear secrets.&#34;American Prometheus&#34; is a compelling portrait of a brilliant, ambitious and flawed man, and of the major events of the twentieth century. It is at once biography and history, and essential to our understanding of our recent past - and our future choices.</p><p>In <i>American Prometheus</i>, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin delve deep into J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and deliver a thorough and devastatingly sad biography of the man whose very name has come to represent the culmination of 20th century physics and the irrevocable soiling of science by governments eager to exploit its products. Rich in historical detail and personal narratives, the book paints a picture of Oppenheimer as both a controlling force and victim of the mechanisms of power. <p> By the time the story reaches Oppenheimer's fateful Manhattan Project work, readers have been swept along much as the project's young physicists were by fate and enormous pressure. The authors allow the scientists to speak for themselves about their reactions to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, avoiding any sort of preacherly tone while revealing the utter, horrible ambiguity of the situation. For instance, Oppenheimer wrote in a letter to a friend, "The thing had to be done," then, "Circumstances are heavy with misgiving." </p><p> Many biographies of Oppenheimer end here, with the seeds of his later pacifism sown and the dangers of mixing science with politics clearly outlined. But Bird and Sherwin devote the second half of this hefty book to what happened to Oppenheimer <i>after</i> the bomb. For a short time, he was lionized as the ultimate patriot by a victorious nation, but things soured as the Cold War crept forward and anti-communist witchhunts focused paranoia and anti-Semitism onto Oppenheimer, destroying his career and disillusioning him about his life's work. Devastated by the atom bomb's legacy of fear, he became a vocal and passionate opponent of the Strangelovian madness that gripped the world because of the weapons he helped develop. </p><p> Twenty-five years of research went into creating <i>American Prometheus</i>, and there has never been a more honest and complete biography of this tragic scientific giant. The many great ironies of Oppenheimer's life are revealed through the careful reconstruction of a wealth of records, conversations, and ideas, leaving the clearest picture yet of his life. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>"American Prometheus is the first full-scale biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, "father of the atomic bomb," the brilliant, charismatic physicist who led the effort to capture the awesome fire of the sun for his country in time of war. Immediately after Hiroshima, he became the most famous scientist of his generation-one of the iconic figures of the twentieth century, the embodiment of modern man confronting the consequences of scientific progress. <br>He was the author of a radical proposal to place international controls over atomic materials-an idea that is still relevant today. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb and criticized the Air Force's plans to fight an infinitely dangerous nuclear war. In the now almost-forgotten hysteria of the early 1950s, his ideas were anathema to powerful advocates of a massive nuclear buildup, and, in response, Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss, Superbomb advocate Edward Teller and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover worked behind the scenes to have a hearing board find that Oppenheimer could not be trusted with America's nuclear secrets. <br>"American Prometheus sets forth Oppenheimer's life and times in revealing and unprecedented detail. Exhaustively researched, it is based on thousands of records and letters gathered from archives in America and abroad, on massive FBI files and on close to a hundred interviews with Oppenheimer's friends, relatives and colleagues. <br>We follow him from his earliest education at the turn of the twentieth century at New York City's Ethical Culture School, through personal crises at Harvard and Cambridge universities. Then to Germany, where he studied quantum physics with the world's mostaccomplished theorists; and to Berkeley, California, where he established, during the 1930s, the leading American school of theoretical physics, and where he became deeply involved with social justice causes and their advocates, many of whom were communists. Then to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where he transformed a bleak mesa into the world's most potent nuclear weapons laboratory-and where he himself was transformed. And finally, to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, which he directed from 1947 to 1966. <br>"American Prometheus is a rich evocation of America at midcentury, a new and compelling portrait of a brilliant, ambitious, complex and flawed man profoundly connected to its major events-the Depression, World War II and the Cold War. It is at once biography and history, and essential to our understanding of our recent past-and of our choices for the future.</p><h2>Freedom Lost (Deathlands)</h2><p>Investigating troublesome rumors, Ryan Cawdor and his band of survivalists journey to what was once a Carolina shopping mall and are forced to join the sec team of the fortress&#39;s baron.

Buddy Bell, president and founder of the Ministry of Helps International, Inc., in Tulsa, Oklahoma, originally began serving in the ministry of helps in his local church by doing with excellence all his hand could find to do. Sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit, Rev. Bell began developing highly effective methods of ushering, conspicuous only in their reflection of God&#39;s character and love. Ushers following his example or trained by him functioned supernaturally. As they maintained the order necessary to allow the power of the Holy Spirit to flow forth to minister, they spread God&#39;s love. People&#39;s needs were met not only in the services, but elsewhere in the church building, even in the parking lot. Consequently, churches began requesting Rev. Bell&#39;s usher and general ministry of helps training. Rev. Bell began holding workshops, speaking at conferences, serving as a consultant to churches, filming videos and writing manuals and books to meet the need. His training, coupled with his hilarious presentation, have been in great demand. He has now traveled to more than 2,000 churches, teaching and helping church staffs and congregations awake to the power and plan of the Holy Spirit for accomplishing the work of the ministry through every believer. Rev. Bell has authored the Ministry of Helps Handbook revealing how to be totally effective serving in the ministry of helps. He has also produced &#34;The complete Local Church Usher Training System,&#34; &#34;Development of Local Church Leadership Notebook,&#34; and 20 videos utilized by more than 15,000 churches worldwide. Rev. Bell&#39;s humor, zeal and anointing from God to present ministry of helps training motivates people in a most delightful manner to find their place and fulfill their ministry in the local church.&#34;I highly recommend this book to every current or potential usher committed to serving his local church...&#34; --Dr. John C. Maxwell</p><h2>Economic Sentiments: Adam Smith, Condorcet, and the Enlightenment</h2><p><p> In a brilliant recreation of the epoch between the 1770s and the 1820s, Emma Rothschild reinterprets the ideas of the great revolutionary political economists to show us the true landscape of economic and political thought in their day, with important consequences for our own. Her work alters the readings of Adam Smith and Condorcet--and of ideas of Enlightenment--that underlie much contemporary political thought. </p><p> <i>Economic Sentiments</i> takes up late-eighteenth-century disputes over the political economy of an enlightened, commercial society to show us how the "political" and the "economic" were intricately related to each other and to philosophical reflection. Rothschild examines theories of economic and political sentiments, and the reflection of these theories in the politics of enlightenment. A landmark in the history of economics and of political ideas, her book shows us the origins of laissez-faire economic thought and its relation to political conservatism in an unquiet world. In doing so, it casts a new light on our own times. </p></p><p><b>Emma Rothschild</b> is a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and Director of the Center for History and Economics, King's College.In her readable as well as scholarly book, <i>Economic Sentiments</i>, [Rothschild] links [Adam] Smith with the French philosopher the Marquis de Condorcet, another thinker seen today as an emblem of "cold hard and rational enlightenment" but in reality interested, like Smith, "in economic life as a process of discussion, and as a process of emancipation," in which "one's freedom to buy or sell or lend or travel or work is difficult to distinguish from the rest of one's freedom." This larger picture, Rothschild thinks, is what was lost as economics developed along with the society it analyzed, and what she hopes to restore. (Paul Mattick <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2001-07-08)<br><br>This landmark work revisits the intellectual ferment of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries...[Rothschild] dismantles, with quiet authority, the stereotype of the Enlightenment as a period dominated by chilly rationalists. (<i>New Yorker</i> 2001-06-04)<br><br>One of the many virtues of <i>Economic Sentiments</i> is that it provides exactly what its subtitle says: an investigation of 'Adam Smith, Condorcet, and the Enlightenment.' Another, even more attractive than an unusual degree of truth in advertising, is that it casts an extraordinarily revealing light on many other writers and many other moments in history. It is a book that does with great success two things that are usually thought to be wholly antithetical; certainly they are rarely attempted by the same writer. On the one hand, it takes us back into the last third of the eighteenth century, and shows us what economic thinking was like before it became modern economic theory, on the other, it complicates the image of the Enlightenment in ways that are intended to make the political discussions of the twenty-first century more sophisticated, nuanced, and self-conscious than they often are. (Alan Ryan <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2001-07-05)<br><br>Economic historians often discuss the half century after 1770 with barely a nod (or none at all) to the political revolutions. Emma Rothschild, however, turns that convention on its head. Her book examines the period from the vantage point of two of the most influential economic writers of the time--Adam Smith and the Marquis de Condorcet--and their followers...The book's distinctive approach brings real and unexpected insights. (William Kennedy <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i> 2001-06-22)<br><br>In her brilliantly illuminating and compelling reinterpretation of Adam Smith and Condorcet, Emma Rothschild presents a view of late 18th century ideas through which we can ourselves re-envision the human realities of life in the market. In so doing, she has produced a masterpiece of the historical imagination. First and foremost, <i>Economic Sentiments</i> is a rich, profound and at times revelatory essay in the history of ideas which will undoubtedly become part of the academic canon. But it is also an inspiring commentary on our own times, which can be read with profit by many outside the academy. (John Gray <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 2001-12-02)<br><br>One must look hard to find a work so adept at doing the vigorous hermeneutics required to truly understand what drove the 18th-century Enlightenment and how that era impacts our thinking today. Rothschild roams across the landscape of thinkers and historical events focusing on Condorcet as an example of the 'cold, universalistic enlightenment of the French Revolution' and on Smith, who appears as the more conservative proponent of the 'reductionist enlightenment of laissez-faire economics.' Along the way the reader is challenged to rethink the positive-normative dichotomy commonly taught in economics, the meaning and role of Smith's 'invisible hand' and the self-serving manner in which 19th-century interpreters framed Smith's ideas...There is exceptional depth to this book...[It] has interdisciplinary appeal, systematically relying on literary, philosophical, political, economic, natural science, and sometimes theological disciplines to build arguments. Highly recommended. (J. Halteman <i>Choice</i> 2001-11-01)<br><br>A lucid and historical account of one of the finest achievements of the European Enlightenment, the application of the new science of political economy to the solving of real problems. Emma Rothschild shows that modern free-marketeers who neglect the political and moral aspects of Adam Smith's writings are unfair to the man whose name they have hijacked.

Even when the Italians do invade, life isn't so bad--at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of "Heil Hitler" with his own "Heil Puccini," and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies, and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches. <p> British author Louis de Berni�res is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as <i>The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts</i>, <i>Se�or Vivo and the Coca Lord</i>, and <i>The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman</i>. Here he keeps it to a minimum, though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his island--the drunken priest, the strongman, the fisherman who swims with dolphins--would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead, de Berni�res seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. <i>Corelli's Mandolin</i> works on many levels, as a love story, a war story, and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>3 hours<br>Read by Stephen Lang<br><br>Now available unabridged on CD and cassette.<br><br>Newly released movie tie-in edition.<br><br>The time -- fifty years ago.

It chronicles the days and nights of the island's inhabitants -- the widowed doctor, his brainy daughter and her innocent (or deadly) fisherman fiance, the wine-besotted priest, the gentle strongman giant, the ancient political debaters down at the tavern, and the uninvited newcomers: in particular, the reluctant head of the Italian garrison -- the charming, mandolin-playing</p><h2>Comfort Detox: Finding Freedom from Habits that Bind You</h2><p>&#34;For too long I have lived life on comfort mode, making choices for life engagement based on safety, ease, and convenience. It has left me very little wiggle room, just a small parcel of real estate upon which to live, move, and have my being. It&#39;s not quite the abundant life Jesus was offering.&#34; Whether we&#39;re aware of it or not, our minds, bodies, and souls often seek out what&#39;s comfortable. Erin Straza has gone on a journey of self-discovery, awakening to her own inherent drive for a comfort that cannot truly fulfill or satisfy. She depicts her struggles with vulnerability and honesty, and shares stories of other women who are on this same path. Straza also provides practical insights and exercises to help you find freedom from the lure of the comfortable. This detox program will allow you to recognize pseudo versions of comfort and replace them with a conviction to embrace God&#39;s true comfort.

Never has it been more vital that we don't.

His arrogance and abrasive manner had alienated his wife, her sister, his houseguests, his wayward son, even a desperate friend.

English Heritage has awarded Georgette Heyer one of their prestigious Blue Plaques, designating her Wimbledon home as the residence of an important figure in British history. She was born in Wimbledon in August 1902. She wrote her first novel, The Black Moth, at the age of seventeen to amuse her convalescent brother; it was published in 1921 and became an instant success.<br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. A very private woman, she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or personal life. Her work included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a barrister, and they had one son, Richard.<p>One</p> <p>It was apparent to Miss Fawcett within one minute of her arrival at the Grange that her host was not in the best of tempers. He met her in the hall, not, she believed, of design, and favoured her with a nod. 'It's you, is it?' he said ungraciously. 'Somewhat unexpected, this visit, I must say. Hope you had a good journey.' </p> <p>Miss Fawcett was a young lady not easily discouraged. Moreover, she had been General Sir Arthur Billington- Smith's sister-in-law for five years, and cherished no illusions about him. She shook him briskly by the hand, and replied with perfect equanimity: 'You know quite well it's impossible to have a good journey on this rotten line, Arthur. And how you can say I'm unexpected when I sent an expensive telegram to prepare you both for the joy in store for you &#x2014;'</p> <p>The General's scowl deepened. 'Short notice, you'll admit!' he said. 'I suppose you've brought a ridiculous quantity of baggage?'</p> <p>'Something tells me,' remarked Miss Fawcett intelligently, 'that I'm not really welcome.'</p> <p>'Oh, I've no doubt Fay's delighted!' replied the General, with a short laugh. 'Though where she is I don't know. She packs the house with visitors, but can't trouble herself to be here when they arrive.'</p> <p>At this moment his erring wife came down the stairs. 'Oh, darling!' she said in a voice that held a plaintive note. 'How lovely to see you! How are you?'</p> <p>Miss Fawcett embraced her warmly. 'Hullo, Fay! Why didn't you send a wire to put me off ? Arthur's all upset about it.'</p> <p>The large, rather strained blue eyes flew apprehensively to the General's face. 'Oh, no!' Fay said. 'Arthur doesn't mind having you, Dinah. Do you, Arthur dear?'</p> <p>'Oh, not at all!' said the General. 'You'd better take her up to her room instead of keeping her standing about in the hall.'</p> <p>'Yes, of course,' Fay said. 'You'd like to come up, wouldn't you, Dinah?'</p> <p>This was said a trifle beseechingly, and Miss Fawcett, who wore all the signs of one about to do battle, relaxed, and agreed that she would like to go up to her room.</p> <p>'I've had to put you in the little west room,' Fay told her. 'I knew you wouldn't mind. We're &#x2014; we're rather full up.'</p> <p>'Yes, so I gathered,' said Dinah, rounding the bend of the staircase. 'It seems to be worrying little Arthur.'</p> <p>She had a clear, carrying voice. Fay glanced quickly down the stairs. 'Dinah, please!' she begged.</p> <p>Dinah threw her a glance of slightly scornful affection, and replied incorrigibly: 'All right, but it's putting an awful strain on me.'</p> <p>They ascended the remaining stairs in silence, but as soon as the door of the west room was securely shut on them Dinah demanded to know what was the matter with Arthur.</p> <p>Lady Billington-Smith sank down on to a chair, and put up one of her thin hands to her head, pushing the pale gold hair off her brow in a nervous gesture peculiar to her. 'Something dreadful has happened,' she answered. 'It has upset Arthur terribly.'</p> <p>'Ha!' said Dinah, casting her hat on to the bed. 'The cook burned his Sacred Porridge, I suppose.'</p> <p>A slight smile flickered across her sister's face. 'Oh, don't be an ass, Dinah, for heaven's sake!'</p> <p>'Well, that was it the last time I came,' said Dinah, hunting in her dressing-case for a comb.</p> <p>'This is much worse. It's Geoffrey.'</p> <p>'Dipped again?' inquired Miss Fawcett sympathetically. 'Worse than that, even. He's engaged to be married. At least, he says he is.'</p> <p>Miss Fawcett combed out her short brown locks, and began to powder her nose. 'Barmaid, or tobacconist's assistant?' she asked, as one versed in the follies of young men.</p> <p>'Neither. She's a cabaret dancer.'</p> <p>Miss Fawcett gave a crow of laughter. 'Oh, no! No cabaret dancer would fall for Geoffrey.'</p> <p>'Well, this one has. And it isn't even as though she's English. She's a Mexican.' Lady Billington-Smith allowed this piece of information to sink in, and followed it up by a final announcement. 'And he's bringing her here to spend the week-end.'</p> <p>'But how rich! how luscious!' exclaimed Dinah. 'I wouldn't have missed it for anything. Has Geoffrey gone mad, do you suppose? Who is the girl?'</p> <p>'Her name,' replied Fay, 'is Lola de Silva. It sounds awfully improbable, doesn't it? It &#x2014; it put Arthur off right away. I've had rather a dreadful time with him, because Geoffrey wrote to me, not to his father, and &#x2014; and asked me to break the news. I'm afraid Geoffrey's quite infatuated. He seems to think Arthur has only to see this Lola person and he'll fall for her.'</p> <p>'The joys of being a stepmother,' commented Dinah. 'Is that what Arthur meant when he said that you'd packed the house full of people?'</p> <p>'Partly, I expect. But he's blaming me for having the Hallidays now, just because he'd rather they weren't here when Geoffrey comes.'</p> <p>'And who,' asked Dinah, 'are the Hallidays? Kindly enumerate.'</p> <p>'People we met in the south of France,' replied Fay, a little guardedly. 'He was knocked up in the War, and she's &#x2014; she's rather pretty, and smart.' She raised her eyes to her sister's face and coloured faintly. 'Well, you're bound to see it. Arthur flirts with her. That's why they're here.'</p> <p>'More fool you to invite them,' said Dinah sternly.</p> <p>'You don't understand. Arthur made me.' Dinah snorted.</p> <p>'It's no good, Dinah. You're the fighting sort, and I'm not. Anyway, it doesn't matter. He doesn't mean anything serious, and if it keeps him in a good temper I don't mind.'</p> <p>'Anyone else here?' asked Dinah, abandoning a hopeless topic.</p> <p>'Yes, Francis. He arrived in time for lunch.'</p> <p>Dinah grimaced. 'If I'd known he was going to be here I wouldn't have come. What's he turned up for? To touch dear Uncle Arthur? That'll make it a very merry party. Anyone else?'</p> <p>Fay got up, apparently to rearrange the flowers that stood in a vase on the dressing-table. 'Only Stephen Guest,' she replied.

This introduction to Bradbury, written especially for students, traces Bradbury's interesting life, examining his early literary efforts, his forays into Hollywood, and his recent writing projects. Eight of Bradbury's major works are discussed at length, each in its own chapter, including two works published within the last ten years: <i>A Graveyard for Lunatics </i>(1990) and <i>Green Shadows, White Whale </i>(1992). Clear, thoughtful analysis is also given for <i>The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man,</i> <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, and <i>Death Is a Lonely Business</i>.</p><p></p><p>In each chapter, analysis of the important literary components is given: plot, setting, characters, and themes. In addition, the genesis, critical reception, and an alternate reading of each work is also discussed in clear terms for students and general readers.

The secrets of the hit TV series <i>The Avengers</i> are laid bare by the man who <i>was</i> John Steed.<br><br>Lavishly illustrated, with many unpublished stills, behind-the-scenes photos, and snaps from Macnee's private collection, this is a very personal portrait of the world's best-loved cult action-adventure series, and its classic sequel, <i>The New Avengers</i>. <br><br>In unflinching detail, Macnee reveals the true story behind the show, including his relationships with all four <i>Avengers </i>girls �&#x20ac;&#x201d; Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg, Linda Thorson and Joanna Lumley �&#x20ac;&#x201d; on <i>and</i> off the set!</p><p>There have been five James Bonds, but even Ralph Fiennes, star of the <i>Avengers</i> movie admits that there is only one John Steed. When he first donned his iconic bowler hat, actor Patrick Macnee put an eccentric spin on the traditional English gentleman. Witty, urbane, a stickler for etiquette, and able to disarm the most dastardly villain with a casual flick of his tightly furled umbrella, Steed helped London to swing during the heady days of the 1960s.<p> <i>The Avengers and Me</i> is Macnee's memoir of his time on the cult TV show. Reading the book is like sitting down with the actor over a nice cup of tea as he reminisces about life behind and in front of the cameras.

One day, Morris&#39;s dad read him an article about an American dog trainer living in Switzerland. This is the story of his relationship with Buddy, his own seeing eye dog.</p><p><p>The Seeing Eye is still in existence today and continues to provide dogs and lifetime training to qualified people. The author, Becky Hall, lives in Utah. Doris Ettlinger, who also illustrated <i>Pilgrim Cat</i>, lives in New Jersey.</p>Grade 2-4&#x2013;This illustrated biography reads like a story. In 1928, 20-year-old Morris Frank, who had lost his sight four years earlier, traveled to Europe like a package. Onboard the steamship, he was dependent on attendants to take him from place to place and locked in his cabin at night. His life changed, however, when he reached his destination, Vevey, Switzerland, where American dog trainer Dorothy Harrison Eustis and her colleague Jack Humphrey were waiting to teach him to work with the German shepherd he eventually christened Buddy. The narrative clearly conveys the trials of man and dog as they learned to trust one another, and the beginnings of Morris's work to bring guide dogs to the United States. The book ends on a high note with Morris crossing a dangerous street in New York City to demonstrate Buddy's reliability to the press. An afterword summarizes the rest of his crusade, which culminated in the establishment of a school named The Seeing Eye and the passage of legislation allowing guide dogs in public places. Although Ettlinger's illustrations highlight important moments, they pale in comparison to the appended archival photos of Morris and Buddy. Eva Moore's <i>Buddy</i> (Scholastic, 1996) covers much of the same material, but tells the story more from the dog's perspective.&#x2013;<i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Carroll County Public Library, MD</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One hundred and sixty years later, Tina Plank, an unhappy teenager, meets Trixie, a girl with a troubled past, and the two become fast friends. But when two skeletons are accidentally unearthed from their common ground, the lives of Tina and Trixie, Cookie and Henry are brought together in unexpected and startling ways.</p></p><p><p>Jonathan Raymond attended Swarthmore College. He was an editor at Plazm magazine and received his M.F.A. from New School University. He currently lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p>Friendship is the theme of this ambitious and assured debut novel, which is set in Oregon and spans a hundred years of change in the region. In the 1820s, Cookie is a young man employed by a roughneck party of fur trappers as their cook. With food supplies running low, the mood is grim; on a foraging expedition Cookie discovers the bedraggled Henry, who is hiding from a band of murderous Russians, and stows him away in the chow wagon. After the party successfully reaches Fort Vancouver, the two shack up together in the woods, and Henry dreams up the get-rich scheme of traveling to China to sell castoreum oil, which they extract from beavers. In an alternating parallel narrative, set in the 1980s, two teenage girls living on a commune outside of Portland also form an alliance. Tina, a California transplant, bonds with Trixie, a girl with a troubled past. Matters become complicated on the commune when two skeletons are found on the property, setting off a political tug of war between forensic scientists and members of a local Indian tribe. As the two narratives alternate�&#x20ac;"Cookie and Henry run into trouble in China, while Tina and Trixie scrimp and save to produce an amateur film�&#x20ac;"Raymond carefully probes the delicate imbalances that develop in both friendships. The synchronicity of the two stories is subtly engineered and never belabored; convergences are balanced by some unexpected divergences. Whether chronicling the hardscrabble culture of settlers in new territory or the discontent with sprawling overdevelopment generations later, Raymond supplies a wealth of detail about the Pacific Northwest, making plain both the rewards and sacrifices of progress. When tragedy strikes for both sets of friends, it feels as natural as the landscape, surely and deftly closing Raymond's circle of ambiguity, loss, loyalties and love. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She nags them to pack their bags, to get ready on time, and to not forget their sneakers. She feels bad for nagging them, and all of it takes me back to when Daughter Francesca was ten years old and we had one of the best fights of our life.<br>And yes, you can have a good fight with your daughter.<br>If you&#x2019;ve read me before, you know that I think fighting is healthy and normal, and a good fight is when you learn something from your kid. Not when you win.<br>If you win, ten years later, your daughter will turn up pregnant.<br>Don&#x2019;t try to win. Try to learn.<br>But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself.<br>I&#x2019;ll never forget the day of our fight, because it&#x2019;s when I started traveling light.<br>Now I have it all figured out, especially with respect to nagging. We either do what our mothers did, or we do the exact opposite.<br>And hopefully, this is a conscious choice, since in due time, if we have any self-awareness at all, we catch on and live the examined life. We figure out our own way to parent, and even to live. We don&#x2019;t have to become our mothers unless we want to.<br>We have free will, and better shoes.<br>Most of the time, I want to become Mother Mary. I parent the same way Mother Mary did, in many ways, mainly in loving my kid more than words can say and saying so, complete with hugging, kissing, praising, and celebrating in general.<br>Mother Mary thinks it&#x2019;s cute when I fart, and that&#x2019;s what we call unconditional love.<br>Love is such a positive emotion, and kids need to hear it all the time, even grown-up kids. It makes everybody happier, like a hearty plate of spaghetti.<br>I&#x2019;m Italian, remember?<br>But one thing that Mother Mary did not do is nag.<br>And there&#x2019;s a reason for that.<br>Let me remind you that Mother Mary grew up as the youngest of nineteen children. This is not a joke. Well, at least, I&#x2019;m not kidding.<br>The Flying Scottolines were excellent Catholics, way back when.<br>Her mother, my grandmother, was married twice because her first husband died, probably from the exertion.<br>Even Italians have limits.<br>Anyway, I grew up with Mother Mary telling me stories from her childhood, all of which rival <i>Angela&#x2019;s Ashes</i> for their cheeriness. There were siblings who died in infancy. The family was so poor they ate her pet rabbit. There was no money to send anybody to college, and though my mother did well in school, her mother wanted her to drop out and get a job.<br>Nobody puts Mother Mary in a corner.<br>She defied her mother, worked while she went to high school, and graduated at the top of her class.<br>God bless her.<br>But even her funnier stories from her childhood make it sound like she was raised by wolves. Half the time, her parents didn&#x2019;t know she was around. Once she got pneumonia, and nobody noticed. No one helped her with her homework, got her to a dentist or doctor, or made sure that she had books or clothes, much less that she was dressed and ready for anything on time. In fact, she walked half the city to go to her high school, through some very rough neighborhoods, all by herself.<br>Needless to say, nobody nagged Mother Mary.<br>So when she raised me, she didn&#x2019;t know she was supposed to nag me. She didn&#x2019;t get the memo.<br>She made a decision to be more loving than her mother, and love came naturally to her. But although she loved us, and was there when she needed us, she just wasn&#x2019;t in our business. She always worked as a secretary, and we let ourselves in after school and were generally responsible for ourselves.<br>Not that I&#x2019;m complaining. Brother Frank and I had a great childhood. We grew up happy, healthy, and pretty much in charge of our own fates. And when we got burned, we felt the consequences.<br>So we never did it again.<br>For example, Brother Frank started to ditch English classes in high school, and my parents didn&#x2019;t catch on until a notice came home saying he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to graduate.<br>Opera ensued.<br>My parents went hysterically to the school, which agreed to let him graduate if he went to summer school to make up the classes, but also required him to walk at the end of the processional line at graduation.<br>This was worse than it sounds.<br>The processional line was in order of height, and the guy at the end of the line was so tall he went on to play for the NBA.<br>Brother Frank was five feet, six inches.<br>At graduation, he looked like a sheepish caboose, or a punctuation mark at the end of capital letters, LIKE THIS.<br>And everybody laughed, eventually even Frank.<br>Fast forward to when I become a mother, with a daughter, and in the meantime, the world has changed. Walking at the end of the procession isn&#x2019;t the worst that can happen anymore. There&#x2019;s meth addiction, psycho killers, and reality television.<br>So you know where this is going.<br>I started nagging.<br>When Francesca was little, I nagged her to do her homework, take a bath, clean her room, and wear a heavier coat, and she always told me to stop nagging. Then one day, I remember the morning, she was in fifth grade, and I was rushing her out the door, nagging that we&#x2019;d be late to school, and she simply burst into tears.<br>She said, &#x201c;Mom, you&#x2019;re ignoring me. I&#x2019;m asking you not to nag me, and you&#x2019;re ignoring what I say.&#x201d;<br>And I looked at my child, whom I had made cry, her round blue eyes brimming with tears. And finally, I heard her. I realized she was right. She has never been late for anything. She was even born on her due date.<br>I was nagging her because I needed to nag her, not because she needed to be nagged.<br>And that&#x2019;s why they call it emotional baggage.<br>I&#x2019;m learning to check it, in all senses of the word.<br>Because I still carry it around, whether it&#x2019;s the way I parent or the way I deal with my daughter, my friends, men, the people I work with, and even my dogs.<br>Dogs don&#x2019;t have emotional baggage.<br>And if they did, they&#x2019;d forget it at the airport.<br>They know they don&#x2019;t need it.<br>So I look for when it gets in the way of my relationships, especially mine to Francesca, as she grows older. We are best friends, but we&#x2019;re still smoothing out the wrinkles between us. It&#x2019;s a lifelong process, because we both keep growing, and those wrinkles have made for some of the best, worst, saddest, and funniest moments of my life.<br>This is a book that chronicles those moments. It&#x2019;s about our lives, my daughter&#x2019;s and mine, living both together and apart, as we both grow older. Precious few books are devoted to a mother&#x2019;s relationship with her adult child, which is crazy, because these bonds become more important, not less, as time goes on.<br>Family is forever.<br>So read on.<br>I bet that these stories will resonate with you, because you&#x2019;ve had moments like these, too. The only difference between us is that Francesca and I wrote them down.<br>And, as you may have guessed, I haven&#x2019;t stopped nagging, not completely, especially not since she moved to New York, where the meth addicts and psycho killers form a processional of their own.<br>Just kidding.<br>Though you&#x2019;ll read in the following pages about Francesca&#x2019;s adventures in the big city, complete with her own personal flasher.<br>The truth is, sometimes nagging is required, and sometimes it isn&#x2019;t, and the most anybody can ask of a mother is that we pause, examine what we&#x2019;re doing and why, then nag if it&#x2019;s in order. Then it&#x2019;s a conscious choice, and we reserve the right to nag.<br>Because we&#x2019;ve lived longer, and we know more. Even if you&#x2019;re an adult child, we&#x2019;re still more adult.<br>And you have to listen to us.

He has been the recipient of the James Tait Black Memorial Prize (1976), the Guardian Fiction Prize (1981), the Guinness Peat Aviation Book Award (1989), and the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction (1997). He has been both shortlisted for the Booker Prize (1989) and awarded the Man Booker Prize (2005) as well as nominated for the Man Booker International Prize (2007). Other awards include the Franz Kafka Prize (2011), the Austrian State Prize for European Literature (2013), and the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature (2014). He lives in Dublin.An eminent but broken-down art historian named Kreutzner lives in an island aerie with his strange assistant Licht--and the two one day find themselves playing host to a party of strangers who've been shipwrecked when the chartered boat they were on ran aground offshore. The Professor is the world's greatest authority on the painter Vaublin--creator of Watteau-like scenes of out-of-time mystery, of Pierrot figures gracefully adrift in ambiguous landscapes. When late in the story a newly released convict makes his way to the island as well and takes up residence among the dispossessed of the house, adding yet another character to its unclear society of confused sleepwalkers, Banville (Kepler, 1983; The Book of Evidence, 1990, etc.) has the last element needed to complete his rather mist-laden tableau: ``It is the very stillness of their world that permits them to endure; if they stir they will die, will crumble into dust and leave nothing behind save a few scraps of brittle lace, a satin bow, a shoe buckle, a broken mandolin.'' Quickly discovered by a reader, however, is that nothing is going to happen in this book except prose--high-quality, vaguely old-fashioned art prose--all of it dependent on a connoisseur's patience as the sentences noodle through the art/illusion hoops Banville sets up. Just as no character here does anything (though in the past each might have done something), Banville neither tries to overturn his allegory nor heighten it; he seems placidly satisfied just to set up its pieces and see if they stand. Precious in a showoffy way--and deadly static. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i></p><h2>Elmo&#39;s World: Music!

Alexei, Elena, and Nikolka Turbin have just lost their mother their father had died years before and find themselves plunged into the chaotic civil war that erupted in the Ukraine in the wake of the Russian Revolution. In the context of this family&#x2019;s personal loss and the social turmoil surrounding them, Bulgakov creates a brilliant picture of the existential crises brought about by the revolution and the loss of social, moral, and political certainties. He confronts the reader with the bewildering cruelty that ripped Russian life apart at the beginning of the last century as well as with the extraordinary ways in which the Turbins preserved their humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this volume Marian Schwartz, a leading translator, offers the first complete and accurate translation of the definitive original text of Bulgakov&#x2019;s novel.

It is set in Kiev during the Russian revolution and tells a story about the war's effect on a middle-class family (not workers). The story was not politically correct and thereby contributed to Bulgakov's lifelong troubles with the Soviet authorities. It was, however, well-loved, and the novel was turned into a successful play at the time of its publication in 1967.<p>Marian Schwartz is a prize-winning translator of Russian who recently received her second Translation Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts to translate Olga Slavnikova&#x2019;s newest novel, <i>2017</i>.

It draws surprising conclusions, many of which debunk conventional wisdom and which will no doubt cause debate among scholars, journalists, veterans, military personnel, and ordinary Americans who lived through the war era. Like no other book before it, Argument Without End allows us to look at the decisions that led to the war and to its tragic, ultimately pointless continuation. It also shows conclusively that the war could not be won militarily by the United States. One of the most important works on Vietnam to be published, Argument Without End is also a book of lasting relevance to all who seek to quell the conflicts between nations.</p></p><p>Between 1995 and 1998, Robert S. McNamara led a series of blunt conversations between American and Vietnamese scholars and officials. "The discussions were frank and tough throughout, as befits the first-ever discussion by former enemies of this tragic war," writes McNamara, author of the controversial bestseller <i>In Retrospect</i> and the U.S. secretary of defense from 1961 to 1968. "Had this dialogue occurred in real time, rather than in retrospect, I believe the tragedy could have been prevented." That's probably an overstatement, but it's a useful starting point for this inquiry, in which many contributors probe the causes of the war and try to draw lessons from them. <p> The structure of <i>Argument Without End</i> is unconventional, with McNamara writing introductions and conclusions to most of the chapters, which sometimes read like excerpts of transcripts and often like pieces of analytical history. Readers will get the sense of observing a graduate-level seminar on the war, with some of its most knowledgeable participants and critics making presentations. The result is a provocative text eager to challenge assumptions. McNamara's presence hangs over everything--this really is <i>his</i> book, despite the numerous coauthors sharing credit--and his sense of optimism is eerie. "Both Hanoi and Washington could have accomplished their purposes without the appalling loss of life," he writes. A statement like that shows 20/20 hindsight, yet it's an awfully candid remark from a man who had much to do with America's humiliation in Southeast Asia. This is an important contribution to our understanding of that terrible conflict. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>Robert S.

But his masterful storytelling and prose style go beyond the awe-inspiring Malazan world. In <i>The Devil Delivered and Other Tales</i>, Erikson tells three different, but captivating stories: </p><p>"The Devil Delivered" tells a story set within the near future, where the land owned by the great Lakota Nation blisters beneath an ozone hole the size of the Great Plains. As the natural world falls victim to its wrath, and scientists scramble to understand it, a lone anthropologist wanders the deadlands, recording observations that threaten to bring the entire world to its knees. </p><p>"Revolvo" takes place in an alternate Earth where evolution took an interesting turn and the arts scene is ruled by technocrats who thrive in a secret, nepotistic society of granting agencies, bursaries, and peer-review boards, all designed to permit self-proclaimed artists to survive without an audience. </p><p>"Fishin' with Grandma Matchie" is told in the voice a nine-year-old boy, writing the story of his summer vacation. What starts as a typical recount of a trip to see Grandma quickly becomes a stunning fantastical journey into imagination and perception in the wild world that Grandma Matchie inhabits.</p></p><p>Archaeologist and anthropologist Steven Erikson's debut novel, <i>Gardens of the Moon</i>, was shortlisted for the World Fantasy Award. His <i>New York Times </i>bestselling series, 'The Malazan Book of the Fallen, has been hailed as a masterpiece of epic fantasy.

Jim&#x2019;s eyes followed it, bright with wonder. His horse&#x2019;s russet flanks felt hot and solid under his thighs. He curved his lower back and slid down a ways on the saddle.<br>Grandpa had clucked his palomino mare ahead a dozen or so steps, out to the hill&#x2019;s crest. The old man had turned and now squinted steadily at Jim.<br>&#x201c;What do you see this time?&#x201d; Grandpa asked.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just how you said it&#x2019;d be,&#x201d; Jim answered. He remembered what his grandfather had told him last winter. There&#x2019;d been a foot of wind-hardened snow blanketing this hilltop, and the deep drifts in the valley below had been sculpted into fantastic patterns. They&#x2019;d covered the six miles from the farm in the morning&#x2019;s early hours, jogging overland and using the elk-gut snowshoes Grandpa had made the day Jim was born, nine years past. And he remembered what Grandpa had talked about that day&#x2014;all the old, old stories, the places and lives that had slipped into and out of the family&#x2019;s own history, on their way into legend. Batoche, Riel, McLaren and the Redcoats, and Sitting Bull himself. It was the family&#x2019;s M�tis blood, the old fur trade routes that crossed the plains, and of course the buffalo. All a part of Jim now, and especially this particular hilltop, where heroes had once gathered. Where they had talked with the Old One, whose bones slept under the central pile of stones.<br>Jim let his gaze drop and scan the space between the two horses. The pile remained&#x2014;it had barely broken the snow&#x2019;s skin last winter, but now the hub of boulders threw its lumpy shadow across the west half of the Medicine Wheel, and the rows of rocks that spoked out from it completed a perfect circle around them.<br>&#x201c;Who Hunts the Devil,&#x201d; Grandpa said quietly.<br>Jim nodded. &#x201c;The Old One.&#x201d;<br>The wind blew dry and hot, and Jim licked his parched lips as Grandpa&#x2019;s blunt French and Plains Cree accent rolled the words out slow and even, &#x201c;He was restless in those days. But now&nbsp;... just silence.&#x201d; The old man swung his mount round until the two horses and their riders faced each other. Grandpa&#x2019;s weathered face looked troubled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking he might be gone, you know.&#x201d;<br>Jim&#x2019;s gaze flicked away, uneasily studied the prairie beyond. The sun&#x2019;s light was crimson behind a curtain of dust raised by the Johnsons&#x2019; combines.<br>Grandpa continued, &#x201c;Could be good for wheat, this section....&#x201d;<br>The boy spoke slowly. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;d mean plowing all this up&#x2014;the Medicine Wheel, the tepee rings&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So it would. The old times have passed, goes my thinking. Your dad, well, soon he&#x2019;ll be taking over things, and that&#x2019;s the way it should be.&#x201d;<br>Jim slumped farther in his saddle, still staring at the sunset. Dad didn&#x2019;t like being called M�tis, always said he was three-quarters white and that was good enough and he didn&#x2019;t show his Indian blood besides. Jim&#x2019;s own blood was even thinner, but his grandfather&#x2019;s stories had woken things in him, deep down inside. The boy cleared his throat. &#x201c;Where did your grandpa meet Sitting Bull again?&#x201d;<br>The old man smiled. &#x201c;You know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wood Mountain. He&#x2019;d just come up after killing Custer. He was on the run, and the Redcoats were on their way from the East, only they were weeks away still.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s when&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sitting Bull gave your grandpa his rifle. A gift, because your grandpa spoke wise words&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know how wise they were,&#x201d; Grandpa cut in; then he fell silent, his gaze far away.<br>Jim said nothing. He&#x2019;d never heard doubt before, not in the telling of the stories, especially not in this one.<br>After a long moment filled only by the wind and an impatient snort from the palomino, Grandpa spoke on, &#x201c;He told Sitting Bull that the fight was over. That the Americans would come after him, hunt him down. That the White Chief couldn&#x2019;t live without avenging the slaughter&#x2014;that the White Chief&#x2019;s justice counted only with the whites, not for Indian dogs. Sitting Bull was tired, and old. He was ready for those words. That&#x2019;s why he called them wise. So after McLaren arrived, he took his people back. He surrendered, and was starved then murdered. It would&#x2019;ve been a better death, I think, if he&#x2019;d kept his rifle.&#x201d;<br>Jim straightened and met his grandfather&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want this plowed up, Grandpa. Maybe Who Hunts the Devil is gone, but maybe he isn&#x2019;t. Maybe he&#x2019;s just sleeping. If you wreck the Medicine Wheel, he&#x2019;ll be mad.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your father wants to plant wheat, Jim. That&#x2019;s all there is to it. And the old times are gone. Your father understands this. You have to, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Once the harvest&#x2019;s in, we&#x2019;ll come out here and turn over the land.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s empty, you see. The buffalo are gone. I look around&nbsp;... and it&#x2019;s not right. It&#x2019;ll never be right again.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, it will, Grandpa. I&#x2019;ll make it right.&#x201d;<br>The old man&#x2019;s smile was broken, wrenching at Jim&#x2019;s heart. &#x201c;Listen to your father, Jim. His words are wise.&#x201d;<br><b><i>Val Marie, Saskatchewan Precinct, June 30, Anno Confederation 14</i></b><br>William Potts opened his eyes to the melting snow puddled around his hiking boots. He rubbed his face, working out the aching creases around his mouth. A smile to make people nervous, but it was getting harder to wear.<br>Slouched in an antique chair and half-buried by his bootsuit, he turned his head an inch, to meet the eye of a diamondback rattlesnake probing the glass wall beside him. An eye milky white, the eye of a seer proselytized limbless and mute, but scabbed with deadly knowledge all the same.<br>The aquarium sat on a stained oak end table, its lower third layered in sand and gravel. Stone slabs crowded the near end. A sun-bleached branch stripped of bark lay in the center, angled upward in faint salute. At the far end, two small buttons of cacti, possibly alive, possibly dead&#x2014;hard to tell despite the tiny bright red flowers.<br>The snake was avoiding its tree, succinctly coiled on a stone slab, its subtle dun-colored designs pebbled by scales that glittered beneath the heat lamp.<br>William watched its tongue flick out, once, twice, three times, then stop.<br>He grunted. &#x201c;We are rife in threes.&#x201d;<br>At the crowded basement&#x2019;s far end, Old Jim rummaged through a closet, his broad hunched back turned to William.<br>&#x201c;This guy&#x2019;s eyes,&#x201d; William said, frowning at the snake, &#x201c;are all milky white.&#x201d; He lowered his voice. &#x201c;Time to shed, then?

Thick with dust and the breath of ghosts. Glass-topped tables housed chert and chalcedony arrowheads, ground-stone axes and mauls, steatite tobacco pipes, rifle flints and vials full of trade beads. White beads, red beads, turquoise beads. Furniture shaped by homesteaders&#x2019; rough, practical hands filled every available space. Cluttering the walls: faded photographs, racks of pronghorn, elk, deer, heads of wolf, bear, coyote, old provincial license plates from before the North American Confederation, quilts, furs, historical maps. A fossilized human femur dug out from three-million-year-old gravel beds that, before the Restitution, would have been called an anomaly and deftly ignored.<br>William smiled. &#x201c;Three million ten thousand years of history jammed into this basement, Jim.

Each organization has a unique environment, but as Ross Harrison explains in <i>Strategic Thinking in 3D</i>, any environment&#x2014;whether in the fields of national security, foreign policy, or business&#x2014;has three dimensions: systems, opponents, and groups. Systems strategy involves the challenge of creating leverage against opponents by shaping the external environments they rely on for sustaining their power. Opponents-based strategy requires analyzing a competitor&#x2019;s capability, motivation, and strategy, assessing one&#x2019;s own competitive challenges, and then developing approaches for directly confronting the opponent. Group strategy aims to mobilize political, consumer, and market groups against the power of an opponent. <i>Strategic Thinking in 3D</i> makes strategy &#x201c;portable&#x201d; for individuals who switch careers multiple times during their professional lives, moving among public, nonprofit, and private sector jobs. Harrison uses al Qaeda&#x2019;s strategy against the United States as a &#x201c;capstone&#x201d; case study to demonstrate how strategic success often results from the cascading effect of &#x201c;wins&#x201d; in all three of these dimensions. Conversely, strategic failure can come from the mutual reinforcement of &#x201c;losses&#x201d; across these same three dimensions. Reinforcing and integrating the concepts, Harrison shows how strategy in 3D actually works in practice.</p><p>ROSS HARRISON is a professor in the practice of international affairs at the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and also teaches Middle East politics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has served as a corporate CEO, has been on corporate advisory boards, and has worked with an international NGO on its strategic challenges. A member of a group of colleagues (from the U.S. Army War College) that works on improving the teaching of strategy, Harrison lives in Washington, D.C."I strongly recommend this book to all strategists&#x2014;it will certainly get you thinking about strategic thinking."&#x2014;Michael R. Matheny, <i>Strategos</i> (Michael R. Matheny <i>Strategos</i>)<br><br>"Anyone interested in strategy should read this book."&#x2014;Lt. Col. Sean Kern, <i>Air Force Research Institute</i> (Lt. Col. Sean Kern <i>Air Force Research Institute</i>)<br><br>"<i>Strategic Thinking in 3D</i> is accessible, thought provoking, and pragmatic for a wide range of individuals who may wrestle with the challenges of an uncertain and competitive environment. The value in Harrison's work is not that it provides answers but asks the questions that drive leaders and their organizations to explore factors which may have strategic effect and substantive impact&#x2014;then enables the crafting of viable strategies."&#x2014;Charles D. Allen, Colonel (USA Retired), <i>Parameters</i> (Charles D. Allen, Colonel (USA Retired) <i>Parameters</i>)<br><br>"<i>Strategic Thinking in 3D</i> does much to expand the traditional understanding of strategic theory from a narrow subject lacking commonality between multiple fields of activity to a universal framework for achieving one's goals."&#x2014;Alexander B. Gray, <i>Naval War College Review</i> (Alexander B. Gray <i>Naval War College Review</i>)<br><br>"Ross Harrison's <i>Strategic Thinking in 3D</i> provides an incredibly practical primer on strategy that is as useful to military professionals as it is to business leaders."&#x2014;<i>Marine Corps University Journal</i> (<i>Marine Corps University Journal</i>)<br><br>"Professor Harrison illustrates the power of lateral thinking by exploring diverse 'external' arenas where strategy is required, while also making readers aware of the vital importance of 'internal' readiness to conduct strategy.

He's simply one of the ten best authors working in the field today." &#x2014;CEMETERY DANCE WEEKLY</p><p>For over 13 years, James A. Moore has been writing novels, role-playing game supplements, and numerous short stories, as well as the occasional comic book script. He is a member of the Horror Writers Association, where he served as an officer for three terms. Jim has published over half a dozen novels including Serenity Falls, Under the Overtree, Rabid Growth, Possessions, and Fireworks. He lives in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.Set in fictional Black Stone Bay, R.I., Moore's contemporary vampire novel offers plenty of traditional horror chills leavened with flashes of humor. The affluent community descends into turmoil after Jason Soulis, a cryptic and distinguished older gentleman, arrives in town before Halloween. Soulis recruits a college student to moonlight as a call girl and seduce all the Black Stone Bay clergy as part of an effort to create a crisis of faith. People begin vanishing and their loved ones find themselves confronted with ghostly versions of family members. Madness spreads like the plague, leaving the local police officers scrambling to respond. Moore (<i>Writ in Blood</i>) doesn't feel bound by the classic attributes of vampires familiar to Bram Stoker's readers, but his variations aren't especially interesting and his failure to give Soulis much of a backstory or motivation lessens the overall impact. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The answer could lie in the Hapes consortium, a cluster of sixty-three high-tech worlds. There is only one catch: Princess Leia must marry the Queen Mother&#39;s son, the dashing and wealthy Prince Isolder. Han Solo reacts badly to the news. Tricking Leia, he flees with her to the beautiful but untamed planet of Dathomir, where he hopes to change her mind -- and win her heart. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker and Artoo form an unlikely partnership with the jilted prince to track down the runaways. But their mission is only the beginning of an adventure that will lead to the discovery of an awesome treasure, a group of Force-trained &#34;witches&#34;, and a showdown with and invincible foe.If you thought Han Solo and Princess Leia were an item--not so fast. Leia has visited the planet Hapes to plead with the Queen Mother for weapons and ships; and now the Queen Mother's son, Prince Isolder, has sent his battle fleet to planet Coruscant, along with a mountain of hugely expensive gifts. Isolder, it seems, desires to marry Leia and join his forces with those of the New Republic in the continuing struggle against the Empire. Then Han wins planet Dathomir in a card game and persuades Leia to accompany him there. Luke suspects that Dathomir also harbors someone strong in the Force and discovers the Nightsisters who fought with Yoda's Jedi long ago. With firmer prose, more realistic dialogue, and more action than the previous Star Wars outing (Kathy Tyers's bestselling The Truce at Bakura--not reviewed), this should sell at least as well.

For decades the Karen have been under attack from Burma&#39;s military junta; Zoya&#39;s mother was a guerrilla soldier, her father a freedom activist. She lived in a bamboo hut on stilts by the Moei River; she hunted for edible fungi with her much-loved adopted brother, Say Say. Many Karen are Christian or Buddhist, but Zoya&#39;s parents were animist, venerating the spirits of forest, river and moon. Her early years were blissfully removed from the war. At the age of fourteen, however, Zoya&#39;s childhood was shattered as the Burmese army attacked. With their house in flames, Zoya and her family fled. So began two terrible years of running from guns, as Zoya joined thousands of refugees hiding in the jungle. Her family scattered, Zoya sought sanctuary across the border in a Thai refugee camp. Conditions in the camp were difficult, and Zoya now had to care for her ailing mother. Zoya, a gifted pupil, was eventually able to escape, first to Bangkok and then, with her enemies still pursuing her, in 2004 she fled to the UK and claimed asylum. The following year, at a &#39;free Burma&#39; march, she was plucked from the crowd to appear on the BBC, the first of countless interviews with the world&#39;s media. She became the face of a nation enslaved, rubbing shoulders with presidents and film stars. By turns uplifting, tragic and entirely gripping, this is the extraordinary true story of the girl from the jungle who became an icon of a suffering land.</p><p>Zoya Phan is a 28-year-old ethnic Karen refugee from Burma. As a teenager she was forced to flee her country after her village was attacked by the Burmese Army. She now lives in London and works for the human rights organization Burma Campaign UK.

Yet how much wisdom about sexuality do we really encounter? Frustrated by the lack of any higher understanding about sex many have turned to the ancient teachings of the East for an answer. is the most definitive book on ancient India&#39;s concept of sexuality and the soul ever to be published. In this book, Swami Tripurari meets our desire for a higher realization of our sexual and spiritual potential with deep insights into just how bright our spiritual future can be.</p><p>This book is an absolute treasure and it is delightful to read. You have given the world a prize jewel a book that will teach people to love each other and the Lord, as well.While analysing the mind-set of the spiritual seeker while living in the holiest of places, Sri Vrindavan, I began to develop the chapters of this book. It is a book about just how different sexuality is from spirituality and how, ironically, the two, sex and the soul, are at the same time inseperable. Pure sexuality is the purest spirituality. The nine chapters of this book qualiify this statement, distinguising spirit from matter while establishing the novel idea that the soul has emotions and a sexuality of its own separate from the flesh. This is the precious gift of Sri Caitanya to the world. <p> The self-evident nature of the teaching of Sri Caitanya is its beauty. This book culminates in what appears in the mundane sense to be lawless (and thereby irreligious and nonspiritual) love. This revolutionary concept is called parakiya bhava. In human society to date, nothing higher has been told about the possibilities for loving relationships with Godhead. In this teaching lies the truth of the sexuality of the soul . </p><p>We live in postmodern times, and the religon of divine love of Sri Caitanya is the fulfillment of these times. It can save us from the frustration arising from the fact that we are now, after more than two centuries of so-called resason and enlightenment, morally and spiritually bankrupt. This frustration, although leading us away from senseless sense indulgence to a new and nonmaterial life, does not contain the potential to deliver a life of spiritual love. Sri Caitanya's prema-dharma does. This book, Rasa, explores how this is so.</p></p><h2>Healing and History: Essays for George Rosen</h2><p>. with dw, 1979, 262pp clean copy</p><p></p><h2>The Presence of God in Pastoral Counseling</h2><p>Hardcover and dust jacket, as pictured (chr)</p><p></p><h2>First Thunder: An Adventure of Discovery</h2><p>First Thunder follows a heart's journey from life in Seattle, through intrigue in Greece, to what may be humanity's best hope, hidden in a monastery in India.

After the defeat of Custer at the Little Big Horn in June 1876, the army responded to its stunning loss by pouring fresh troops and resources into the war effort. In the end, the U.S. Army prevailed, but at a significant cost. In this unique contribution to American western history, Paul L. Hedren examines the war&#x2019;s effects on the culture, environment, and geography of the northern Great Plains, their Native inhabitants, and the Anglo-American invaders.</p><p>As Hedren explains, U.S. military control of the northern plains following the Great Sioux War permitted the Northern Pacific Railroad to extend westward from the Missouri River. The new transcontinental line brought hide hunters who targeted the great northern buffalo herds and ultimately destroyed them. A de-buffaloed prairie lured cattlemen, who in turn spawned their own culture. Through forced surrender of their lands and lifeways, Lakotas and Northern Cheyennes now experienced even more stress and calamity than they had endured during the war itself. The victors, meanwhile, faced a different set of challenges, among them providing security for the railroad crews, hide hunters, and cattlemen.</p><p>Hedren is the first scholar to examine the events of 1876&#x2013;77 and their aftermath as a whole, taking into account relationships among military leaders, the building of forts, and the army&#x2019;s efforts to memorialize the war and its victims. Woven into his narrative are the voices of those who witnessed such events as the burial of Custer, the laying of railroad track, or the sudden surround of a buffalo herd. Their personal testimonies lend both vibrancy and pathos to this story of irreversible change in Sioux Country.</p><br></p><p><b>Paul L. Hedren </b>is a retired National Park Service superintendent residing in Omaha, Nebraska.

Hedren begins where most historians have ended: at the moment when the shooting stopped.&nbsp; What came next is the meat of <i>After Custer</i>&#x2014;establishing military posts, building railroads, killing the buffalo.

A rich and extraordinary interesting account of the buildings themselves and of one aspect of the interaction of culture and technology. The many illustrations are a joy." &#x2014; <i>Scientific American</i><br>This profusely illustrated book chronicles the evolution of the architecture of the railroad station in both Europe and America from the 1930s and 1950s. It begins with the earliest train-sheds and follows the progress of station design to the great structures erected in the Victorian Era &#x2014; London's Charing Cross Station (1862&#x2013;64) and Berlin's Anhalter Bahnhof (1872&#x2013;80) among them.<br>Landmarks such as New York's Pennsylvania Station (1906&#x2013;10), designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White, begin the panorama of twentieth-century structures. The story ends mid-century, in the gathering twilight of the railroading era, with such conceptions as Cincinnati's Union Station (1926&#x2013;33) and Rome's Second Stazione Termini (1931&#x2013;51).<br>This great cavalcade of architecture illustrates year by year how the approach to station design developed along with the perceived power of the railroad to mobilize masses of people, revolutionize trade, influence the course of national and international interests, open frontiers, facilitate the rise of suburbia, and more. Fully examined is the station's role as an essential part of a new system of transportation with tremendous power to effect social, economic, and political change.<br>Throughout the book, Dr. Meeks, late Professor of the History of Architecture at Yale University, follows chronologically the station's progress as architecture serving new functions; as an engineering challenge, especially in the construction of huge roofs in new materials; and as a work of art expressing taste and cultural ambition. More than 230 illustrations &#x2014; photographs, illustrations, floor plans, cutaways, and more &#x2014; bring vividly to life one of architecture's most fascinating stories.<br>"Carefully documented by all the apparatus of exacting scholarship, and even better by a fascinating collection of more than 230 pictures." &#x2014; <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p></p><h2>Love Finds You in Wildrose, North Dakota</h2><p>Only the strongest flowers thrive in the wilderness.

His novella Behold the Man won the Nebula Award. He is also the recipient of the World Fantasy Award and the British Fantasy Award, among others. He and his wife, Linda, live in Texas.In this engrossing sequel to The Dreamthief's Daughter (2001), Moorcock weaves history, myth and alternate realities into a seamless whole. In 1951, Oona, the Dreamthief's daughter, and her albino husband, Ulrik von Bek, are enjoying a much needed vacation in Nova Scotia when Indian warriors kidnap Ulrik and drag him into the sea. Oona's search for Ulrik leads her through a maelstrom and into an America nearly 1,000 years in the past. At the same time, Oona's father, the albino Elrik of Melnibon&#x201a;, who is soul bonded to Ulrik, faces disaster. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Elrik dreams himself into the same mythic past in search of the beings who forged his black sword. Ulrik, meanwhile, learns that he was not so much kidnapped as recruited to save the multiverse. The tale's power stems largely from the astounding lyricism of the author's prose, the only flaw being the sometimes stilted and overly expository dialogue about the nature of the multiverse. Yet without these explanations, the complexity and mechanics of Moorcock's creation would confuse many readers, particularly those new to the series. An epilogue promises another installment, which should make fans of well-written and highly original fantasy extremely happy.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Buffalo Bill&#39;s Wild West: An American Legend</h2><p>A panoramic celebration of the colorful characters that made up the Wild West shows, with color and black and white photos throughout.</p><p>history has captured the imagination like the American West, and no presentation of the drama&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surpassed the original Wild West shows.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

But spices have a history of doing much more than adding life to bland foods. They have been the inspiration for, among other things, trade, exploration, and poetry. Priests employed them in worship, incantations, and rituals, and shamans used them as charms to ward off evil spirits. Nations fought over access to and monopoly of certain spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg, when they were rare commodities. Not only were many men&#x2019;s fortunes made in the pursuit of spices, spices at many periods throughout history literally served as currency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Culinary Herbs and Spices of the World</i>, Ben-Erik van Wyk offers the first fully illustrated, scientific guide to nearly all commercial herbs and spices in existence. Van Wyk covers more than 150 species&#x2014;from black pepper and blackcurrant to white mustard and white ginger&#x2014;detailing the propagation, cultivation, and culinary uses of each.

I&#x2019;m wearing a plain, colored shirt and a matching pair of pants, cut from thin material that&#x2019;s easy to pull on. It&#x2019;s early in the morning and I am happy, I feel the same sense of contentment and satisfaction as I do at the first mouthfuls of my favorite meal. There are certain people around me, I don&#x2019;t know them yet, but one day I will, and I&#x2019;m in a certain place, lying on my hospital bed in my own room, nobody is dying around me, outside the day is slowly struggling to its feet like a rheumatic old man, I hear certain words from the mouths of my loved ones, a certain touch on my hand, and the kiss on my cheek feels like the home I have built around me like a shrine.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then one by one my organs give up and my bodily func�tions begin to close down: my brain no longer sends messages to the rest of my body, the flow of blood is cut off, and my heart stops, mercilessly and irreparably, and just like that I no longer exist. Where my body once was now there is only skin and tissue, and beneath the tissue there are fluids, bones, and meaningless organs. Dying is as easy as a gentle downhill stroll.<br>&nbsp;<br>*<br>&nbsp;<br>I am a twenty-two-year-old man who at times behaves like the men of my imagination: my name could be Anton or Adam or Gideon, whatever pleases my ear at any given moment. I am French or German or Greek, but never Albanian, and I walk in a particular way, the way my father taught me to walk, to follow his example, flat-footed and with a wide gait, aware of how to hold my chest and shoulders, my jaw tight, as though to ensure nobody trespasses on my territory. At times like this the woman within me burns on a pyre. When I&#x2019;m sitting at a caf� or a restaurant and the waiter brings me the bill and doesn&#x2019;t ask why I&#x2019;m eating alone, the woman inside me smolders. When I look for flaws in my dish and send it back to the kitchen or when I walk into a store and the assistants approach me, she bursts once again into flames, becoming part of a continuum that started at the moment we were told that woman was born of man&#x2019;s rib, not as a man but to live alongside him, at his left-hand side.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes I am a twenty-two-year-old woman who behaves however she pleases. I am Amina or Anastasia, the name is irrel�evant, and I move the way I remember my mother moving, my heels not touching the ground. I never argue with men, I paint my face with foundation, dust my cheeks with powder, carefully etch eyeliner around my eyes, fill in my brows, dab on some mascara and coif my lashes, put in a set of blue contact lenses to be born again, and at that moment the man within me does not burn, not at all, but joins me as I walk around the town. When I go into the same restaurant, order the same dish, and make the same complaint about the food the waiter does not take it back to the kitchen but tells me the meat is cooked just the way I asked, and when he brings me the check he watches me as if I were a child as I rummage in my handbag and pull out the correct sum of money, then disappears into the kitchen with a cursory <i>Thank you. </i>The man within me wants to follow him, but when I look at what I&#x2019;m wearing, my black summer dress and dark-brown flats, I see that such behavior would be inappropriate for a woman, and so I leave the restau�rant and step out onto the street, where Italian men shout and whistle at me, at times so much that the man inside me curses at them in a low, gruff voice, and at that they shut up and raise their hands into the air as though they have come face-to-face with a challenger of equal stature.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am a man who cannot be a woman but who can sometimes look like a woman. This is my greatest quality, the game of dress up that I can start and stop whenever it suits me. Some�times the game begins when I pull on an androgynous garment, a formless cape, and step outside, and then people start making assumptions, they find it disconcerting that they don&#x2019;t know one way or the other, sitting on public transport and in restau�rants, caf�s, it irritates them like a splinter beneath their finger�nail, and they whisper among themselves or ask me directly: <i>Are you a man or a woman? </i>Sometimes I tell them I am a man, sometimes I say I&#x2019;m a woman. Sometimes I don&#x2019;t answer them at all, sometimes I ask them what they think I am, and they are happy to answer, as though this were a game to them too, they are eager to construct me, and once I&#x2019;ve given them an answer order is finally restored to the world. I can choose what I am, I can choose my gender, choose my nationality and my name, my place of birth, all simply by opening my mouth. Nobody has to remain the person they were born; we can put ourselves together like a jigsaw.<br>&nbsp;<br>But you have to prepare yourself. To live so many lives, you have to cover up the lies you&#x2019;ve already told with new lies to avoid being caught up in the maelstrom that ensues when your lies are uncovered. I believe that people in my country grow old beyond their years and die so young precisely because of their lies. They hide their faces the way a mother shields her newly born child and avoid being seen in an unflattering light with almost military precision: there is no falsehood, no story they won&#x2019;t tell about themselves to maintain the fa�ade and ensure that their dignity and honor remain intact and untar�nished until they are in their graves. Throughout my childhood I hated this about my parents, despised it like the sting of an atopic rash or the feeling of being consumed with anxiety, and I swore I would never become like them, I would never care what other people think of me, never invite the neighbors for dinner simply to feed them with food I could never afford for myself. I would not be an Albanian, not in any way, but some�one else, anyone else.<br>&nbsp;<br>At my weakest moments I feel a crushing sense of sorrow, because I know I mean nothing to other people, I am nobody, and this is like death itself. If death were a sensation, it would be this: invisibility, living your life in ill-fitting clothes, walking in shoes that pinch.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the evenings I sometimes hold my hands out before me, clasp them together, and pray, because everybody in Rome prays and asks God to help them resolve difficult situations. A thing like that can catch on so easily, and so I pray that I might wake up the next morning in a different life, even though I don&#x2019;t even believe in God. I do, however, believe that a person&#x2019;s desire to look a particular way and behave in a certain manner can directly impact the breadth of a shoulder, the amount of body hair, the size of a foot, one&#x2019;s talent and choice of profes�sion. Everything else can be learned, acquired&#x2014;a new way of walking, a new body language, you can practice speaking at a higher pitch or dressing differently, telling lies in such a way that it&#x2019;s not lying at all. It&#x2019;s just a way of being. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s best to focus on wanting things and never on what might hap�pen once you&#x2019;ve got them.<br><br><i>[ . . . ]</i><br><br></p></p><h2>The Sky People</h2><p><p>Marc Vitrac was born in Louisiana in the early 1960's, about the time the first interplanetary probes delivered the news that Mars and Venus were teeming with life&#x2015;even human life. At that point, the "Space Race" became the central preoccupation of the great powers of the world.</p><p>Now, in 1988, Marc has been assigned to Jamestown, the US-Commonwealth base on Venus, near the great Venusian city of Kartahown. Set in a countryside swarming with sabertooths and dinosaurs, Jamestown is home to a small band of American and allied scientist-adventurers.</p><p>But there are flies in this ointment &#x2013; and not only the Venusian dragonflies, with their yard-wide wings. The biologists studying Venus's life are puzzled by the way it not only resembles that on Earth, but is virtually identical to it. The EastBloc has its own base at Cosmograd, in the highlands to the south, and relations are frosty. And attractive young geologist Cynthia Whitlock seems impervious to Marc's Cajun charm.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the western end of the continent, Teesa of the Cloud Mountain People leads her tribe in a conflict with the Neanderthal-like beastmen who have seized her folk's sacred caves. Then an EastBloc shuttle crashes nearby, and the beastmen acquire new knowledge... and AK47's.</p><p>Jamestown sends its long-range blimp to rescue the downed EastBloc cosmonauts, little suspecting that the answer to the jungle planet's mysteries may lie there, among tribal conflicts and traces of a power that made Earth's vaunted science seem as primitive as the tribesfolk's blowguns.

And indeed, our nation should ensure that every child has fair access to good education, including educational technology. It&#39;s time to reach beyond symptoms to foundations of what, how, and why we teach. It&#39;s time to renew a humanizing and holistic vision for American education. And that brings us to the crux of the crisis. The most likely sources from which to draw a humanizing and holistic education are more spiritual than philosophical. At its best, education is a spiritual affair."Addresses the very soul of educators; it will inspire every teacher and parent. . . 'Catholic' in the richest sense of the term-'open to all'" -- <i>Theodore M. Hesburgh</i><br><br>"There is growing public demand for educational reform, but most proposals are limited to technical and piecemeal solutions-like how to raise math scores. Surely what is needed is a bold spiritual vision that renews the foundations of why and how we educate. Educating for Life addresses the very sold of educators; it will inspire every teacher and parent." -- <i>Rev.

Each of these spots, however humble, is worth a visit; even the <i>routier</i>, a restaurant that originally served truck drivers, is a visual feast, with its yellow formica counter, red and white checked napkins, and handwritten menu, antique caf� chairs, and vintage signage. <br> &nbsp;<br> Lovers of Paris will be thrilled to know what streets are particularly beautiful when the snow falls, the history of old telephone exchanges, and where to find old-timers playing <i>p�tanque</i>.&nbsp; This is a book for visitors&#x2014;addresses and phone numbers are listed for each venue&#x2014;and armchair travelers who will be transported to another place and time by the sumptuous photographs.

Down, down he leads us, in intoxicating, nearly hallucinogenic prose-past the Yaqui, the Anasazi, and other ghosts of our collective history, past the hookers, winos, and assorted have-nots outside the prosperous circle by the fire. We meet a prisoner obsessed with painting presidents, sex offenders whose desires are not as alien as we wish, a murderer whose execution does not cure what ails us. "I wound up looking at a world where cannibalism is life," Bowden writes, "and of course, given the diet, a life without a future." He mourns a young artist who couldn't find a reason to keep living and tends a mesquite tree that won't die. And down among its metaphoric roots, he reacquaints us with the appetites-fierce, flawed, human-that might save us too. <i>Blues for Cannibals</i> is scripture for an age when bushes no longer burn.<br></p><p><b>Charles Bowden</b> is a journalist whose work appears regularly in <i>Harper's, Esquire</i>, <i>GQ</i>, and other national publications. He is the author of several previous books of nonfiction. He lives in Tucson.<br>*Starred Review* Bowden, a midwesterner who discovered his spiritual home and totem, the mesquite, in the brutal and beautiful Sonoran Desert, trained as a historian but was destined to become a journalist witnessing life in a violent and volatile world ruled by "cannibals . . . who create nothing but who can consume everything." In a fiery and poetic indictment that continues the feverish social and moral inquiry begun in <i>Blood Orchid</i> (1995), he profiles rapists, drunks, outlaws, a suicidal artist, ne'er-do-wells, and do-gooders; suffers grievously over tortured and murdered children; brilliantly links the story of an institutionalized self-taught artist and convicted killer who obsessively paints pictures of presidents with a blazing reassessment of Lyndon Johnson; chronicles an execution; mourns the death of four friends; and vividly portrays the mighty nineteenth-century Yaqui war leader Cajeme. As furious, wounded, lustful, and compelling as Algren and Miller, Bowden confesses his depthless hunger for women, good food, red wine, sunlight, gardening, and freedom, and warns, presciently, of an inevitable wave of violent change. Fueled as much by love and compassion as by sorrow and rage, Bowden's red-hot blues embrace life in all its confounding intensity. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It was in a summer class in 1915 that Carobeth Laird first met him, handsome and sun-tanned from the field. Her story of their seven-year marriage, written when she was in her seventies and published when she was eighty years old, is a compelling tale that has sold over 250,000 copies. In one sense a chronicle of what it meant to an anthropologist in the early twentieth century, it is also a love story, portraying the curious triangle that developed when a Chemehuevi informant entered the lives of Harrington and the young wife he drove as ruthlessly as he did himself.</p><p>Carobeth Laird</p><h2>Larry Holmes: Against the Odds</h2><p>In a moving autobiography, the former boxing champion describes his rise from poverty to the heights of the boxing world and shares his views on boxing in the 1990s, Mike Tyson, Don King, and today&#39;s top boxers. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>An odd twist of publishing fate once again has former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes locked with and overshadowed by the presence of Muhammad Ali; David Remnick's superb biography of the Greatest, <i>King of the World</i>, was published at the same time. The image of his former sparring partner--the beloved, quick, and graceful Ali--haunted Holmes throughout his career, which is too bad, because Holmes was a terrifically skilled fighter who could both box and hit. Like so many boxing stories, Holmes's begins on the wrong side of the tracks; he fights himself out and up from there. Straight-ahead, hard-working, cautious at times, and free of attending glitz, <i>Against All Odds</i> mirrors Holmes's style in the ring and out of it. Its strength is its candor. Holmes never could hide his emotions--or his petulance. His autobiography makes clear his respect for Ali, his hatred of Don King, and the angers that raged around his fight with Gerry Cooney. Indeed, rage is a character in itself. "It was the part of me that always scared me a little because I never completely accepted the fact that I had it in me," Holmes writes. Accept it or not, he rode it to the title, and, no small feat, held that title for seven years. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>"<i>Against the Odds</i> is as straight as a Larry Holmes left jab. In short, a knockout." --Bert Sugar, <i>Fight Game</i> magazine</p><h2>Wildlife in the Anthropocene: Conservation after Nature</h2><p><p>Elephants rarely breed in captivity and are not considered domesticated, yet they interact with people regularly and adapt to various environments. Too social and sagacious to be objects, too strange to be human, too captive to truly be wild, but too wild to be domesticated&#x2014;where do elephants fall in our understanding of nature? </p><p>In <i>Wildlife in the Anthropocene,</i> Jamie Lorimer argues that the idea of nature as a pure and timeless place characterized by the absence of humans has come to an end. But life goes on. Wildlife inhabits everywhere and is on the move; Lorimer proposes the concept of wildlife as a replacement for nature. Offering a thorough appraisal of the Anthropocene&#x2014;an era in which human actions affect and influence all life and all systems on our planet&#x2014; Lorimer unpacks its implications for changing definitions of nature and the politics of wildlife conservation. <i>Wildlife in the Anthropocene</i> examines rewilding, the impacts of wildlife films, human relationships with charismatic species, and urban wildlife. Analyzing scientific papers, policy documents, and popular media, as well as a decade of fieldwork, Lorimer explores the new interconnections between science, politics, and neoliberal capitalism that the Anthropocene demands of wildlife conservation. </p><p>Imagining conservation in a world where humans are geological actors entangled within and responsible for powerful, unstable, and unpredictable planetary forces, this work nurtures a future environmentalism that is more hopeful and democratic. <br></p></p><p><p>Jamie Lorimer is associate professor of geography and the environment at Oxford University. </p><p>"Against all-too-human accounts of the Anthropocene, Jamie Lorimer envisions a dynamic cosmopolitics for wildlife. He demonstrates how species &#x2018;conservation&#x2019; can somehow proceed as neither mastery nor naturalism but, instead, as necessary experiments in interspecies responsibility."&#x2014;Stacy Alaimo, author of <i>Bodily Natures: Science, Environment, and the Material Self</i></p><br><br><p>"Jamie Lorimer has written a very provocative and relevant book about the future of conservation."&#x2014;<i>CHOICE</i></p><p>"An enlightening and very readable introduction to some key concepts."&#x2014;<i>Human Geography</i></p><p>"An important book for anyone engaged in conservation."&#x2014;<i>Quarterly Review of Biology</i></p></p><h2>Letter on the Search for Awakening 1930-1944</h2><p>Ren� Daumal was a born seeker, but even born seekers need sources, inspiration and method, all of which he found in the teaching of George Ivanovich Gurdjieff, first through his contact with Alexandre de Salzmann, later through sustained work with Jeanne de Salzmann and Gurdjieff himself.In the autumn of 1930, Daumal met and recognized this teaching. The 1930s were kind to him. Increasingly celebrated as a writer, he pursued his spiritual search, found gifted friends and colleagues, met his future wife, Vera Milanova &amp; and set aside time to climb in the Alps. The 1940s were unkind. Impoverished, recently diagnosed with tuberculosis and suffering from the scarcities imposed by the Nazi occupation of France, he continued to write with still more depth and warmth &amp; and continued his correspondence with friends and teachers near and far.Ren� Daumal has come to be recognized since his death in 1944 as an incandescent example of self-realization. Rather than fading with the passage of time, his words today are even more resonant: the culture of our time, the questions of our time, have caught up with him. These are letters to us.</p><p></p><h2>The Haunting of Toby Jugg (Wordsworth Mystery &amp; Supernatural)</h2><p>With an Introduction by Anthony Lejeune <br>Night after night, out there in the moonlight, Something was trying to get in at the bedroom window.

The Secret Committee, conceived in 1912 as a united front against the apostasy of Carl Jung and sealed by Freud's bestowal of antique intaglios, became, notes Grosskurth, ``a metaphor for the psychoanalytic movement itself...a cult of personality'' with Freud acting as both ``guru'' and distant, demanding father. Avidly submitting one another (and assorted romantic interests) to frequently scathing and self-justifying formal and informal analyses, Austrians Otto Rank and Hans Sachs, Hungarian Sandor Ferenczi, German Karl Abraham, and Welshman Ernest Jones, joined later by Russian-born German Max Eitingon, functioned as ``surrogate sons'' within a strikingly dysfunctional family--marked by sabotage, manipulation, and ``aggressively infantile'' jostling. Treating her story as a study of group pathology, Grosskurth uses pointed quotes to show how all of her subjects, especially Freud, used jargon as a cover for real feeling. Sadder still was the adored Freud's puzzling lack of support (he refused to be ``burdened'' by the ideas of others) and human empathy (e.g., failing to comprehend the sensitive Ferenczi's sorrow at his mother's death). Inevitably, as Freud predicted in Totem and Taboo, the anointed sons went their own ways, with, ironically, Freud's biological child, Anna, emerging as his staunchest defender. More emotionally involving, though less theoretically acute, than Janet Sayers's study of the overlapping generation of women psychoanalysts (Mothers of Psychoanalysis--reviewed next issue), the work suffers from a curious reticence. Grosskurth avoids some potentially interesting paths (e.g., Freud's gelid relationship with his own sons) and develops her conclusions so carefully that they become anticlimactic. Nevertheless, a worthy stab at piercing the web of ``mythology, gossip, and rumor'' surrounding the early Freudians. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Eastman (Ohiyesa) (1858-1939) was a mixed-blood Sioux who became one of the best-known Indians of his time. He earned a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth and a medical degree from Boston University. From his first appointment as a physician at Pine Ridge Agency; where he witnessed the events that culminated in the Wounded Knee massacre, he sought to bring understanding between Native and non-Native Americans. He wrote eleven books, some, such as <i>Sister to the Sioux</i> (also available as a Bison Book), in collaboration with Elaine Goodale Eastman. His <i>From the Deep Woods to Civilization: Chapters in the Autobiography&nbsp;of an Indian</i>, <i>Indian Boyhood</i>, <i>Indian Heroes and</i> <i>Great Chieftains</i>, <i>Old Indian Days</i>, and <i>The Soul of the Indian: An Interpretation</i> are all available as Bison Books.</p></p><p>A Sioux Toa told in prose a child of any culture, of any time, can comprehend..And no matter how blurred the boundary between past and present, between unpredictable ghost and pragmatic logic, this rich collection from another time and place offers a contemporary message of great ultimate solace.Charles Alexander Eastman (born Hakadah and later named Oh�ye S&#x2019;a; February 19, 1858 &#x2013; January 8, 1939) was a Santee Dakota physician educated at Boston University, writer, national lecturer, and reformer. In the early 20th century, he was "one of the most prolific authors and speakers on Sioux ethnohistory and American Indian affairs."[1] Eastman was of Santee Dakota, English and French ancestry. After working as a physician on reservations in South Dakota, he became increasingly active in politics and issues on Native American rights, he worked to improve the lives of youths, and founded thirty-two Native American chapters of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). He also helped found the Boy Scouts of America. He is considered the first Native American author to write American history from the Native American point of view.</p><h2>Hazel Wolf: Fighting the Establishment</h2><p>When Hazel Wolf died, at the age of 101, more than nine hundred of her friends - from the governor of Washington to union organizers, from birdwatchers to hunters - crowded Town Hall in Seattle to honor the feisty activist and tell the often outrageous "Hazel stories" that were their common currency. In this book, Hazel herself tells the stories. From twenty years of taped conversations, Susan Starbuck has fashioned both a biography and a historical document, the tale of a century's forces and events as played out in one woman's extraordinary life.<p>Hazel Wolf earned a national reputation as an environmentalist and was awarded the National Audubon Society's Medal of Excellence, an honor she shared with Rachel Carson and Jimmy Carter. She laid the groundwork for a unique coalition of Native Americans and environmentalists who are now working together on issues related to nuclear energy, fisheries, and oil pipelines. She lectured and taught at schools and universities all over the United States. She lobbied Congress on irrigration, labor rights, nuclear energy, and peace, and she corresponded with a global network of environmental leaders. But for all her influence, she never held a political post higher than precinct committee officer in Seattle's 43rd legislative district, and her highest office in the environmental movement was that of secretary in the Seattle Audubon Society, where she served for thirty-five years.</p><p>This book follows Hazel Wolf from childhood to old age, a lifetime of burning with a fierce desire for justice. She saw the quest for justice as a collective responsibility. Time and again, she met that challenge head on. Whether organizing for labor rights or founding chapters of the Audubon Society, battling to save old-growth forests or fighting deportation to her native Canada as a Communist, over and over she put herself in the line of fire.

The readings in this anthology&#x2015;the diaries of a trader and a missionary, the letter of a frontier housewife, the travel account of a wide-eyed young English tourist, the memoir of an escaped slave, and many others&#x2015;are eyewitness accounts of the Ohio frontier. They tell what people felt and thought about coming to the very fringes of white civilization&#x2015;and what the people thought and did who saw them coming.<br><br>Each succeeding group of newcomers&#x2015;hunters, squatters, traders, land speculators, farmers, missionaries, fresh European immigrants&#x2015;established a sense of place and community in the wilderness. Their writings tell of war, death, loneliness, and deprivation, as well as courage, ambition, success, and fun. We can see the lust for the land, the struggle for control of it, the terrors and challenges of the forest, and the determination of white settlers to change the land, tame it, "improve" it.<br><br>The new Ohio these settlers created had no room for its native inhabitants. Their dispossession is a defining theme of the book. As the forests receded and the farms expanded, the Indians were pressured to move out.

Having to do it in public because your mother is a famous actress? Even harder. When your mom crashes and burns after her DUI mug shot is splashed across the internet? Definitely not fun. Then your mom falls for a guy so much younger than she that it would be more appropriate for you to be dating him? That&#x2019;s just a train wreck waiting to happen. <br><br>From Robin Palmer, author of <i>Geek Charming </i>and <i>Wicked Jealous</i>, this is a novel about the most complicated relationship a girl ever has: that with her mother.</p><p>After growing up in Massachusetts and New Jersey, <b>Robin Palmer</b> graduated from Boston University in 1990 and moved to Hollywood where she worked in television for ten years before&nbsp;regaining her sanity and quitting her job to write. In addition to her modern retellings of fairy tales (the second of which--<i>Geek Charming--</i>was recently made into a movie for Disney Channel)&nbsp;she is also the author of the middle grade series <i>Yours Truly, Lucy B. Parker</i> as well as various screenplays, television pilots, and misplaced To Do lists. After a lifetime of living on the left and right coasts, she now lives in Louisiana.Gr 9 Up-Sixteen-year-old Annabelle Jackson must deal with the fallout of her actress mother's self-imposed exile from the Hollywood spotlight. Once famous for her role in a popular sitcom, Janie Jackson is now better known for appearing in the gossip blogs due to her outlandish behavior. Annabelle, who has her own quirky habits and suffers from panic attacks, struggles to hide her mother's increasingly dangerous addictions, but can no longer keep the paparazzi at bay when her mom is arrested for drunk driving on the Pacific Coast Highway. After Janie gets out of rehab, mother and daughter learn that their financial advisor has not only killed himself, but he's also robbed them of their estate. Forced to sell their belongings and move to a small apartment, Annabelle is sure her mother will relapse. However, a chance encounter with a famous action star leads to an audition for a movie that could turn Janie's career around. Suddenly Annabelle is faced with a new town, a responsible parent, and the potential for a romantic love interest. The fairy-tale ending is satisfying, but the dialogue and Annabelle's internal monologues are stilted. Some plot elements feel contrived, and characters struggle to be more than stereotypes. Readers will likely forgive these flaws in favor of a plot-driven story that deals not only with the codependent behavior of a girl with an alcoholic parent, but also the common fears and insecurities of a teenager.-Lynn Rashid, Marriotts Ridge High School, Marriottsville, MD&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

From the outset he was in the center of events, with access to key political and military figures as well as those of exceptional intelligence, experience and courage. All this was to give him invaluable background when he came to write the Bond novels in the post-war era.<br><br>The author has uncovered through official documentation, private papers and contacts the depth of Fleming's work in Naval Intelligence. Fascinating insights emerge of those he worked with and details of covert trips to Europe and North Africa emerge.

Gardens were treasured both as places for relaxation and as plots to grow ornamental plants, fruits, and vegetables. The soothing sound of fountains often added further to the pleasures of life in the garden. Romans constructed gardens in every corner of their empire, from Britain to North Africa and from Portugal to Asia Minor. Long after their empire collapsed, the gardens they had so carefully planted continued to exert influence in the far-flung corners of their former world. The author discusses the many kinds of Roman gardens, from small vegetable and fruit plots to vast, carefully landscaped spaces filled with marble furniture, bronze and marble sculptures, mosaics, pools, and fountains--grand spaces suitable for lavish entertainment of guests. Whether large or small, gardens were an extension of the interior living space of Roman houses; often surrounded by covered walkways, gardens served as cooling refuges in hot climates. This book describes the variety of Roman gardens throughout the empire, from the humblest to the most ornate, which include such renowned locations as Hadrian&#39;s Villa in Tivoli and the gardens of Pompeii and Herculaneum. The influence of Roman gardens is traced through Arabic, medieval, and Renaissance gardens to the present day. The text is accompanied by lavish illustrations, many commissioned especially for this book.</p><p>Patrick Bowe is a garden designer, author and historian. He has led dozens of garden tours to Italy, Greece and other Mediterranean countries.Inspired by the ancient traditions of Near Eastern, Greek, and Egyptian gardens, Roman gardens are to this day an important influence upon garden and landscape design. Bowe looks to the breathtaking accomplishments of Pompeii, Hadrian's Villa, and Herculaneum, using these archaeological sites to set the stage for his discussion of the development of Roman gardens. A lavish array of photographs helps to illustrate Bowe's finely detailed history, producing a reverie where one can feel the heat radiating from the sun-drenched ruins and imagine the resinous fragrance of Mediterranean plants. Images of reconstructed frescoes depict the elaborate architectural devices and ornamentation that characterized Roman gardens, in which trelliswork and mosaic floors, along with grand belvederes, fountains, and colonnades, shape the space. Flora like Madonna lilies, morning glories, and citrus trees appear as examples of specimens cultivated at the time. Bowe has escorted dozens of garden tours, and here he invites readers to traipse across continents from Turkey's Ephesus to England's Stourhead to the Getty Villa in Malibu, California, for an unforgettable journey. <i>Alice Joyce</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Returning to America in 1912, he settled in California, worked in a number of jobs, and later married. It was during the Depression era that he seriously turned his hand to writing, and his first published story appeared in the pulp magazine Black Mask in 1933, followed six years later, when he was fifty, by his first novel, The Big Sleep. Chandler died in 1959, having established himself as the finest crime writer in America.Chandler, whom <i>Time</i> once dubbed the "poet laureate of the loner," was a recluse whose human dealings consisted primarily of long letters dictated, usually, while drunk. This is the third collection of Chandler letters (following <i>Raymond Chandler </i> Speaking in 1962 and <i>The Selected Letters of Raymond Chandler </i> in 1981) and represents never-before-published correspondence (including his first letter to the publisher of <i>The Big Sleep,</i> letters to friends, and letters to Erle Stanley Gardner) and unpublished early writings, which give us, among other treasures, an inquiry to an attorney about the habits of private eyes, a sketch of his meeting with Lucky Luciano, an eyewitness account of a 1940s Oscar ceremony, and numerous critiques of other mystery writers. Hiney, one of Chandler's biographers, and the late MacShane, who edited <i>The Selected Letters,</i> have organized their material into "Five Acts," centering on Chandler's struggles with and thoughts on the writing craft and the writing life, extending from 1909 to two weeks before his death, in 1959. Each section is preceded by helpful biographical notes. This collection includes one of Chandler's last letters, in which he wrote that he pictured Philip Marlowe "always in a lonely room, in lonely streets, puzzled but never quite defeated." The same picture emerges of Chandler in this masterfully edited collection. A must for serious readers of hard-boiled fiction. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A bad mood.</h2><p><b>The mercurial Judy Moody will delight any kid who's known a bad mood or a bad day&#x2014;and managed to laugh anyway.<br></b><br>"Judy Moody was in a mood. Not a good mood. A bad mood. A mad-faced mood."<br><br>To start, Judy Moody doesn't have high hopes for third grade. Her new desk won't have an armadillo sticker with her name on it. Her new classroom will not have a porcupine named Roger. And with her luck, she'll get stuck sitting in the first row, where Mr. Todd will notice every time she tries to pass a note to her best friend, Rocky. An aspiring doctor, Judy does have a little brother who comes in handy for practicing medicine, a cool new pet, and a huge Band-Aid collection. <br><br>Judy also has an abundance of individuality and attitude, and when Mr. Todd assigns a very special class project, she really gets a chance to express herself! Megan McDonald's spirited text and Peter Reynolds's wry illustrations combine in a feisty, funny first chapter book for every kid who has ever felt a little out of sorts.</p><p>The first day of third grade puts Judy Moody in a mad-face mood. She just knows everyone will come back from summer vacation with word T-shirts, like "Disney World" or "Jamestown: Home of Pocahontas." All Judy has is a plain old no-words T-shirt. She'll have to go to a new classroom, with a new desk, and she won't have an armadillo sticker with her name on it like she did last year. And knowing her luck, she'll end up sitting next to Frank, the boy who eats paste. For breakfast her dad makes eggs with the yellow middle broken, and her younger "bother," Stink, thinks he knows everything now that he's starting second grade. But bad moods never last long with the irrepressible Judy Moody, and before long, her day--and year--look brighter. Mr. Todd assigns the class a "Me" collage, which sets Judy on a lively and hilarious self-exploration over the next few action-packed weeks.<p> Prolific author Megan McDonald (<i>Beezy</i> and <i>Insects Are My Life</i>) introduces readers to a thoroughly charming, independent, willful heroine, who is far more upbeat than she likes to let on to her reading audience. Remarkably understanding adults populate Judy's world, allowing her to express her witty, resourceful self freely. Peter Reynolds's personable line drawings complement McDonald's text in a light, pleasing style. (Ages 6 to 10) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Megan McDonald grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with four older sisters, and she says that most of the stories in Judy Moody "grew out of anecdotes about growing up with them." In fact, she made Judy the oldest sister because she "wanted to see what it's like to be in charge!" Megan McDonald is the author of numerous children's books and lives with her husband in Sebastopol, California.<br><br>Peter Reynolds is an award-winning animator, artist, author, Web site creator, and educator.

Katherine (the "shrew" of the original) has died, and Petruchio takes a second wife, Maria. Maria denounces her former mildness and vows not to sleep with Petruchio until she "turn him and bend him as [she] list, and mold him into a babe again." After many comedic exchanges and plot twists, Petruchio is finally "tamed" in the eyes of Maria, and the play ends with the two reconciled. The play is seen to reflect how society's views of women, femininity, and "domestic propriety" were beginning to change. It is said that Fletcher wrote this play to attract Shakespeare's attention - the two went on to collaborate on at least three plays together. </p><p>This brand new New Mermaid edition offers unique and fresh insight into the critical interpretation of the play. It builds on current critical foundations (the relationship with <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, gender relations etc) and suggests different areas of interest (popular associations of the shrew, the question of reputation, and a re-examination of the play's structure). as well as examining stage history and recent productions.</p></p><p>Lucy Munro is Lecturer in English at Keele University.</p><h2>The Maestro Myth: Great Conductors in Pursuit of Power</h2><p>Examining the nature of the orchestra conductor, The Maestro Myth is a vigorous analysis of musical ambition and achievement. Acclaimed by critics, this refreshingly iconoclastic history of a profession which has all too often been the object of sycophantic reverence, is also a chronicle of individual endeavor and ambition. Photos.</p><p>Music critic/provocateur Norman Lebrecht didn&#39;t make the high muckety-mucks of the classical music industry at all happy with this iconoclastic book, but he did open a lot of eyes. In 328 fascinating pages, he exposes the foibles and failings (musical and otherwise) of the great conductors of the last century. Why are there so few really outstanding conductors, and so many surface-skimming mediocrities? How did the conductor go from a mere time-beater to a powerful, immensely well-paid figure who jets from continent to continent and from podium to podium, hobnobbing with presidents and tycoons instead of with other musicians? Lebrecht explores all these factors, along with the history of conducting, and in the process dishes a few good anecdotes. He also shines the light on Ronald Wilford, the superagent of Columbia Artists Management, Inc., who controls the careers of more than 100 conductors--and, therefore, controls much of classical music. Lebrecht gets a few facts wrong (mostly minor--there haven&#39;t, for example, been stockyards in Chicago for some decades), but most of his points are well taken.Here, music-journalist Lebrecht (Mahler Remembered, 1987--not reviewed) cannonades world-famous, power-hungry conductors for their facades and for placing money over the welfare of orchestras. Lebrecht bolsters his thesis with an anecdotal history of conducting since Beethoven's Ninth. The first conductor of great fame, he says, was Hans von B low, Wagner's prot g , who was necessary for organizing Wagner's gigantic operas. Unhappily for von B low, Wagner stole his wife, Cosima Liszt, in the summer of 1865, following which the humiliated conductor led the four-hour premiere of Tristan und Isolde. Then Wagner cast von B low out of his service and von B low went on to become the first internationally acclaimed wandering conductor, despite bad nerves and mental problems. According to Lebrecht, von B low set the style that led to Leonard Bernstein, once the most traveled conductor on earth. Lebrecht sets forth the good example of Mahler, who exhausted himself trying to forge a great opera house out of Vienna Court Opera: ``He set the standard by which all operatic regimes are judged,'' Lebrecht says. The early great conductors, from Arthur Nikisch up to Wilhelm Furtw ngler, had a sense of family with their players and, like Mahler, focused on the growth of their home orchestra. But post-WW II conductors, Lebrecht argues, have spread themselves thin and become divorced from the players while building mythic images and raking in fees from recording companies. Lebrecht scores lacerating cuts to the reputations of Bruno Walter (``a pig''), Arturo Toscanini (the icon whose brutality became widely imitated), Herbert von Karajan (the ex-Nazi who became the richest classical musician in history), Leonard Bernstein, and many others.

A million rats, delinquent Girl Scouts out for revenge, and a secret city below the streets of Manhattan combine in this remarkable novel about a darker side of New York City you have only just begun to know about...</p></p><p><p><b>KIRSTEN MILLER </b>divides her time between New York City and Paris, drinking coffee and writing the next Kiki Strike novel.<br><b>www.kikistrike.com</b></p>Grade 5-8&#x2013;Ananka Fishbein, a seventh grader at an expensive New York City school, likens her life to flavorless mush. But when she wakes up one Saturday morning and finds that the small park across the street has become a sinkhole, her decision to explore it transforms her existence. She meets the mysterious Kiki Strike, and subsequently the group of girls (each with a particular talent) who call themselves the Irregulars, and they embark on an adventure that involves exploring the Shadow City, a series of tunnels under Manhattan. The identity of Kiki, along with the motives of the mysterious individuals the Irregulars suspect are planning to attack the city, are the mysteries at the heart of the story. Miller pulls readers in immediately and takes them on a series of twists and turns, culminating in a thrilling climax complete with international politics and intrigue. If a 12-year-old can be a hard-boiled detective, Ananka Fishbein is one. Her narration is fresh and funny, and the author's unadorned, economical, yet descriptive style carries her character through with verve. There are deft portrayals, with personalities artfully revealed through dialogue. The chapter endings are punctuated with selections from Ananka's guidebook on essential skills. Often placed so as to advance the story, they include How to take advantage of being a girl. <i>Kiki Strike</i> celebrates the courage and daring of seemingly ordinary girls, and it will thrill those who long for adventure and excitement while they impatiently await the next installment.<i>&#x2013;Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

First published before the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, this is an infuriating, inspiring, and altogether pioneering work of cultural criticism that investigates money, marketing, and the anti-corporate movement. <br><br>As global corporations compete for the hearts and wallets of consumers who not only buy their products but willingly advertise them from head to toe&#x2014;witness today&#x2019;s schoolbooks, superstores, sporting arenas, and brand-name synergy&#x2014;a new generation has begun to battle consumerism with its own best weapons. In this provocative, well-written study, a front-line report on that battle, we learn how the Nike swoosh has changed from an athletic status-symbol to a metaphor for sweatshop labor, how teenaged McDonald&#x2019;s workers are risking their jobs to join the Teamsters, and how &#x201c;culture jammers&#x201d; utilize spray paint, computer-hacking acumen, and anti-propagandist wordplay to undercut the slogans and meanings of billboard ads (as in &#x201c;Joe Chemo&#x201d; for &#x201c;Joe Camel&#x201d;). <br><br><i>No Logo </i>will challenge and enlighten students of sociology, economics, popular culture, international affairs, and marketing.<br><br>&#x201c;This book is not another account of the power of the select group of corporate Goliaths that have gathered to form our de facto global government. Rather, it is an attempt to analyze and document the forces opposing corporate rule, and to lay out the particular set of cultural and economic conditions that made the emergence of that opposition inevitable.&#x201d;&#x2014;Naomi Klein, from her Introduction <br></p><p>We live in an era where image is nearly everything, where the proliferation of brand-name culture has created, to take one hyperbolic example from Naomi Klein's <i>No Logo</i>, "walking, talking, life-sized Tommy [Hilfiger] dolls, mummified in fully branded Tommy worlds." Brand identities are even flourishing online, she notes--and for some retailers, perhaps best of all online: "Liberated from the real-world burdens of stores and product manufacturing, these brands are free to soar, less as the disseminators of goods or services than as collective hallucinations." <p> In <i>No Logo</i>, Klein patiently demonstrates, step by step, how brands have become ubiquitous, not just in media and on the street but increasingly in the schools as well. (The controversy over advertiser-sponsored Channel One may be old hat, but many readers will be surprised to learn about ads in school lavatories and exclusive concessions in school cafeterias.) The global companies claim to support diversity, but their version of "corporate multiculturalism" is merely intended to create more buying options for consumers. When Klein talks about how easy it is for retailers like Wal-Mart and Blockbuster to "censor" the contents of videotapes and albums, she also considers the role corporate conglomeration plays in the process. How much would one expect Paramount Pictures, for example, to protest against Blockbuster's policies, given that they're both divisions of Viacom?</p><p> Klein also looks at the workers who keep these companies running, most of whom never share in any of the great rewards. The president of Borders, when asked whether the bookstore chain could pay its clerks a "living wage," wrote that "while the concept is romantically appealing, it ignores the practicalities and realities of our business environment." Those clerks should probably just be grateful they're not stuck in an Asian sweatshop, making pennies an hour to produce Nike sneakers or other must-have fashion items. Klein also discusses at some length the tactic of hiring "permatemps" who can do most of the work and receive few, if any, benefits like health care, paid vacations, or stock options. While many workers are glad to be part of the "Free Agent Nation," observers note that, particularly in the high-tech industry, such policies make it increasingly difficult to organize workers and advocate for change.</p><p> But resistance is growing, and the backlash against the brands has set in. Street-level education programs have taught kids in the inner cities, for example, not only about Nike's abusive labor practices but about the astronomical markup in their prices. Boycotts have commenced: as one urban teen put it, "Nike, we made you. We can break you." But there's more to the revolution, as Klein optimistically recounts: "Ethical shareholders, culture jammers, street reclaimers, McUnion organizers, human-rights hacktivists, school-logo fighters and Internet corporate watchdogs are at the early stages of demanding a citizen-centered alternative to the international rule of the brands ... as global, and as capable of coordinated action, as the multinational corporations it seeks to subvert." <i>No Logo</i> is a comprehensive account of what the global economy has wrought and the actions taking place to thwart it. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>There's a bad mood rising against the corporate brands. No Logo is the warning on the label. <p>Once a poster boy for the new economy, Bill Gates has become global whipping boy. Nike's swoosh - the marketing success of the nineties - is now equated with sweatshop labour, and teenage MacDonald's workers are joining the Teamsters. What is going on? No Logo, an incisive and insightful report from the frontlines of mounting backlash against multinational corporations, explains why some of the most revered brands in the world are finding themselves on the wrong end of a bottle of spray paint, a computer hack, or an international anti-corporate campaign.</p> <p>No Logo uncovers a betrayal of the central promises of the information age: choice, interactivity, and increased freedom. And as job security disappears, the respectful reverence which corporations enjoyed as engines of the economy is also dissipating - as is their protection from worker and citizen rage.</p> <p>Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic expos�, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective.

Mendels (ancient history, Hebrew Univ. of Jerusalem) presents an in-depth study of Jewish nationalism in the Hellenistic world, from 200 B.C.E. to the failure of the Bar Kochba Revolt in 135 C.E. Mendels anchors his work in four key concepts that, he states, form the basic foundation for defining ancient nationalism: territory, temple or cult, kingship, and army.

Maureen lives with her family in Texas where she is hard at work on her next novel.Natasha "Tasha" Bloom sat in the large, mahogany-paneled conference room of her grandfather's mansion and tried to warm herself from the chill. Like everyone else who'd traveled to the cemetery for his burial, she was nearly soaked to the skin from standing in the torrential rain during the ceremony. The tentlike structure set up by the funeral home staff to shield the family from the mid-June downpour had been little more than four poles and a tarp that obviously hadn't been designed to withstand gale-force winds because as soon as the pastor had begun reading the words, a powerful gust had picked it up and sent it flying across the cemetery's well-kept grounds. Since Walker Bloom's death three days ago, it had been raining like Miami under hurricane warnings. Those who knew him well figured he'd dialed up the weather just to make everyone miserable.<br><br>In the front of the room stood Gunther Hayden, her grandfather's attorney. As far as Tasha knew, Gunther's only job was to keep the monthly alimony checks flowing into the accounts of her grandfather's four ex-wives, known collectively by Walker as the Witch Bitches. All were seated around the conference table. They hated him, but he'd hated them more. The only wife he'd ever loved was his first wife, Rhonda, the mother of Tasha's dad, Marshall. Tasha never knew her grandmother because she died before Tasha was born.<br><br>Tasha discreetly scanned the faces of the other people invited to witness the reading of the will. Many were employees from his various enterprises: chauffeurs, housekeepers, vice presidents, administrative assistants. Walker Bloom had been an auto industry legend. In the fifties and sixties his designs spawned cars that revolutionized what America drove. As a result, he'd made a ton of money.<br><br>Further panning showed a group of men standing by the door. By their heights and girth she guessed them to be members of the Michigan Freighters, the minor-league football team her grandfather owned. When her eyes locked onto the dark gaze of Drew Davis, her heart stopped. He gave her an almost imperceptible nod of greeting then looked away. She hadn't seen him at the funeral, but here he was&#x2014;a former All Pro quarterback and presently general manager of the Freighters. He was also still as gorgeous as he'd been the last time she'd seen him twenty years ago. Back then, he'd been a college phenom and she a seventeen-year-old high-school senior with a crush on him larger than the state of Michigan. Feeling all of seventeen again at the sight of him, she gathered herself and redirected her attention to Gunther, who appeared ready to start the proceedings.<br><br>"Okay, everyone. Let's get this under way."<br><br>The large-screen monitor on the wall suddenly went from blank to the face of her grandfather, and a few people jumped in surprise. The Walker Bloom glaring at them now bore little resemblance to the handsome, too-rich-for-his-own-good scoundrel he'd been when Tasha lived under his wing after the death of her parents. His brown-skinned features were ravaged by age and illness, yet he'd remained the sharp-tongued, judgmental hell-raiser he'd always been until he day he died at age eighty-five.<br><br>"If you're watching this, it means I'm dead. So hello to all the vultures."<br><br>Heads shook all over the room. Tasha sighed. She loved her grandfather, but it was like loving a pit bull that made its living attacking the neighbors.<br><br>"First off, to my employees. Because of all of you I was able to afford the best of everything, so thanks. If you worked for me for five years or more, I'm leaving you five years' worth of salary. A few of you will be getting more."<br><br>He directed his next words at Gunther. "And make sure the checks go out as soon as possible. If the employees don't get their money within five business days, fire yourself and bring somebody else on board who can get the job done."<br><br>Tasha watched Gunther's lips tighten. During his thirty-five-year tenure, he'd been fired and rehired more times than anyone in the room could count. However, the employees, like his longtime chauffeur, Tony Craig, and the housekeeper, Carmen Nash, were smiling. A lump sum of five years' salary would pay off mortgages, help with tuition costs and allow some to retire. Walker Bloom could be a pit bull, but he could also be an angel with a heart of gold.<br><br>He then narrowed his eyes as if he had the ability to see the people gathered in the room. "The Witch Bitches get nothing. Zip! Nada."<br><br>Their shocked gasps filled the silence. A couple looked faint. Others looked like they wanted to pull out a Glock.<br><br>"You all signed prenups," he reminded them, "so I hope you didn't come here thinking I'd let you keep feeding at the Bloom trough. And to Barb and Treena, the little bastards you've been passing off as mine, they get nothing either. Had myself fixed forty years ago but never told you. Hope their real fathers make enough money to pay for their fancy schools and clothes from now on."<br><br>The aforementioned Treena, his last ex-wife, who at age thirty-seven was a year younger than Tasha, promptly fainted and crumpled slack-jawed in her leather chair. Gunther ran to her side, shouting for water. Her twelve-year-old son, Walker Jr., stared first at her, then at the man he assumed to be his father before rushing past Drew Davis and his men standing by the door and out of the room. Walker's third wife, Barbara, hurried out as well, trailed by her confused-looking fourteen-year-old daughter, Bianca.<br><br>Tasha was speechless. She'd expected drama but nothing this award-worthy. Had Gunther known about the false paternity? By the shocked look on his blanched face the answer was no.<br><br>The remaining ex-wives snatched up their expensive hand bags and black gloves. With tight-lipped dignity and fire in their eyes, they stood and headed for the way out. As they made their exit, Witch Bitch #2, a bottle blonde named Caroline, flipped the glowering Walker the bird.<br><br>After reviving the weeping Treena, Gunther escorted her out and returned a few moments later alone.<br><br>Up on the screen Walker Bloom grinned like a ghoul. "I assume the coven has left the building."<br><br>Tasha knew smiling would be inappropriate, so she schooled her features not to react. She'd seen him give folks hell most of her life, but this performance from the grave ranked among the best.<br><br>"Now, the only people left to deal with are Drew and Tasha."<br><br>She stiffened. She owned a very successful and highly regarded brokerage firm, and due to the wise investment of the hefty sum of money she'd inherited upon the untimely death of her parents in a plane crash during her college freshman year, she was monetarily set for the rest of her life and didn't expect her grandfather to leave her a dime. In fact, the two of them discussed the subject last summer while on his yacht off Catalina. He'd agreed that she had more money than she'd ever need. Listening to him now, though, made her uneasy.<br><br>"To my granddaughter, Natasha, I leave every damn dime. Every stock, T-bill and certificate of deposit&#x2014;all the houses in the United States and abroad, the cars, the horses, my collection of fine art and any change she finds in the couch cushions."<br><br>Tasha appreciated the humor, but in reality she wanted to smack him upside his head. She didn't need any more wealth. He could've left his estate to a deserving charity or his alma mater, Savannah State.<br><br>"I also leave her my sorry-ass football team, the Freighters."<br><br>That stunned her. He knew of her lifelong pipe dream to own a football team. The unexpected gift made her smile until she saw the shock and anger on the face of Drew Davis. Before she could figure out what his problem might be, her grandfather added, "Drew, I know I promised you the team, but I changed my mind."<br><br>Her mouth dropped. Drew's face was so stonily set it could've been chiseled out of marble. His eyes burning her way were like lava spilling from a volcano.<br><br>"And, Drew, so that you'll stay on as GM and coach and help Tasha out, I'm increasing your salary another fifty thousand. There'll be another five hundred thousand in bonus if you marry her. She needs a man and because she can't seem to find one on her own, I'm okay buying her one."<br><br>"What?" Tasha yelled not realizing she'd jumped to her feet in outrage. Her eyes now resembled Drew's.<br><br>Her grandfather chuckled. "Pretty sure Tasha's on her feet cursing by now, so Gunther, make sure she doesn't pull out that nine millimeter she carries to take a shot at me before I finish."<br><br>She heard a few low chuckles, but her glare silenced them as effectively as any handgun. Drew's eyes now showed amusement mingling with his fury. She added humiliation to her outrage.<br><br>"Hope everyone's satisfied." Walker Bloom smirked. "If not, write me in care of hell. Class dismissed."<br><br>The screen went black.<br><br>Tasha dropped down into her seat while the others in the room began filing out. She was so mad she couldn't see straight. It was a wonder steam wasn't rising out of her rain-dampened suit. She supposed she shouldn't be surprised he'd zinged her, too. Hadn't she already described him as a pit bull? A glance toward the door showed neither Davis nor his team. At least she didn't have to deal with him and his dark-eyed fury right then, but as the new owner she'd have to meet with him eventually, and it wasn't something she was looking forward to. Seething, she glanced up at the dark monitor. Her grandfather had lost his damn mind.<br><br>As Drew Davis drove down Jefferson Avenue toward home, there were no words to describe his rage. Walker Bloom had specifically promised him the team, but apparently his promises meant nothing. He wanted to punch something, wanted to dig up the old bastard and kick his ass. And to leave the team to his granddaughter? The ultimate insult. Drew had only seen her once. She had to have been in high school back then because he was the starting quarterback for State. She'd accompanied Walker to a practice. The exact details of the visit escaped him at the moment, but he vividly remembered throwing her spirals after practice while she tore down the empty football field to catch them. He'd been impressed, but what the hell did she know about running a team? Walker Bloom was the worst team executive Drew'd ever had the misfortune of being associated with; he never came to the games and never, ever wanted to spend a dime on anything. Not salaries. Not medical insurance. Not training facilities. Not anything. Trying to get money out of Bloom was like Bob Cratchit trying to get a raise from Ebene-zer Scrooge, only Scrooge was a philanthropist in comparison. And would she be any better? She might know how to catch a pass, but from the high-class looks of her, she probably knew more about nail polish and shoe shopping than the needs of a semipro football team. A part of him wanted to quit on the spot and say to hell with all of it. Walker Bloom could kiss his ass. If the granddaughter wanted to play at being owner, fine, but he wouldn't be on the sidelines holding her purse while she did.<br><br>Had he not been so enraged, he'd have laughed at the utter outrage on her face in response to the marriage bonus. What kind of man sets his grandchild up for something like that? But then again, this was Bloom he was referencing.<br><br>As he pulled into his driveway, he decided he needed to do some research. The first thing Drew did when he got inside was boot up his laptop. He needed to know as much about Natasha Bloom as possible. An internet search turned up an article on her done six months ago by one of the African American business blogs. She was thirty-eight years old. Received her MBA from Wharton and presently owned a top-tier San Francisco-based brokerage firm with branch offices in London and Milan, which meant she did have a brain somewhere beneath the high-society beauty, but that didn't make him feel better about her being team owner. She had her undergrad degree from Stanford in advertising. He studied the pictures of Tasha. One was taken of her sitting at her desk in her London office, and she was dressed for business in a sharp blue suit. Another was of her at a firing range, and the fierce determination on her face made him pause and rethink her again. When Bloom referenced her packing a nine millimeter, Drew hadn't taken him seriously. According to the article, her father won an Olympic medal in sharpshooting, and she'd learned to shoot at a young age. After her parents died in a plane crash, she was raised from that point on by Walker. Despite all of his marriages, her father was Walker's only son and she his only grandchild. Drew wondered if her ethics were as slippery as her grandfather's. His attention lingered on her photo. She certainly didn't look like the skinny, colt-legged teen he remembered. In fact, seeing her today it took a minute to connect the gorgeous, perfectly made-up beauty to Walker's granddaughter. She was certainly fine enough to get any man she set her sights on, so he wondered why Walker felt it necessary to buy her a man, as he put it. But in reality, that part of the equation didn't matter. Drew was no more interested in marrying her than she in him&#x2014;not even to own the team.<br><br>Pushing back from the desk, he sighed with frustration. There was no way of determining if she'd be accepted by the players&#x2014;not that it mattered. She owned the Freighters, and there was no changing that, but if he decided to stay on, and the verdict was still out on that, he didn't want any of his men to quit the team over the issue. Finding and keeping capable athletes for a minor league team was hard enough without having to deal with this mess. He ran his hands over his eyes. The men knew Drew had been promised the team. None would be happy knowing he'd been shafted.<br><br>A glance down at his watch showed it was time to get ready for work at the jazz club he owned on the Detroit riverfront.<br><br>He'd purchased it out of his love for the genre and to make sure America's only indigenous music form continued to have a presence in a city that loved it just as much. He'd named the place "Drew's." It was common knowledge that many big-name athletes went broke after hanging up their pads. Some of his former teammates could no longer afford the lifestyles they'd grown accustomed to as players because they'd poured their millions into questionable business deals, mansions in South Florida, more cars than they'd ever drive&#x2014;the more expensive the bet-ter&#x2014;and set up parasitic relatives who did nothing but take.<br><br>He hadn't fallen victim to any of that. Although he'd come out of college early with no degree, he'd gone back to school during the latter years of his career. After age and injuries made retirement necessary, he finished his degree in business management and used what he'd learned to put together a small but profitable real estate empire. He owned a number of residential properties and businesses throughout the city, but the jazz club was his baby.</p><h2>Every Dish Delivers: 365 Days of Fast, Fresh, Affordable Meals</h2><p>For most of us, it's a daily question: What to cook?

Known primarily for his collaboration with Le Corbusier and his projects for Pampulha and the visionary Brazilian capital, Brasilia, Niemeyer has designed hundreds of remarkable buildings and master plans during his six-decade career. His experimentation with reinforced concrete produced curved, organic forms that marked an innovative departure from the rectilinear austerity of European modernism. Niemeyer was named an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects in 1963, and he was awarded the Pritzker Prize for Architecture in 1988 and the RIBA Gold Medal in 1998 in honor of his outstanding contributions to architecture.<br>In this autobiography, Niemeyer reveals that philosophy, politics, and his many passions - including his large family, many friends, the sensuous land and open skies of Brazil, the female body, art and literature - have formed the key to his architecture and to his vibrant life. This volume includes notes identifying the people and places cited in the narrative, a chronology of Niemeyer's career, a selection of archival photographs, and forty sketches created by Niemeyer especially for this book.</p><p>Some people live to work while others work to live, and based on this charmingly relaxed and meandering memoir, it would seem that Oscar Niemeyer definitely falls in the latter category. Not to say that he doesn't spend considerable time here musing on his crowning achievement, Brasilia. It's just that he does so the same way that he recounts everything else here, dispensing with details and strict linearity (much like in his built work), shifting casually between different points in time (including the very days he is working on what became this book), and focusing on the human relationships and friendships behind a project (such as with Lucia Costa, his mentor and the so-called "father of Brazilian modernism," as well as Le Corbusier) than their technical, administrative, and budgetary minutiae. <p> Niemeyer designed the vast majority of the municipal buildings for Brasilia, the city built "overnight" in the 1960s out of the desolate interior of his native Brazil to serve as the country's new capital, and the sensuously curvy modernism of its skyline has effectively become his stylistic signature, even if he didn't anticipate the vast and ugly exurban sprawl that has since come to ring the city's dazzling axial core. </p><p> So much more than a professional memoir, this is really the unhurried, and endearingly nostalgic, reminiscences of a passionate man motivated not so much by professional or financial gain (in fact, he claims, he worked for years on Brasilia at the base rate of an average civil servant) as by a profound, even melancholic, love for his beautiful and troubled country; the ongoing struggle for relief from political and economic oppression around the world; and, above all, a vast web of lifelong friendships. To wit, there are far more photos here of Niemeyer with his Brazilian cronies (many long dead, he laments openly) than there are of his projects (one reason why those not already somewhat familiar with his output may want to start elsewhere), and far more recounted about their prank-filled road trips between Rio and Brasilia than about the work that actually went on there. Those tales, and all of Niemeyer's anecdotes and gentle, quirky musings here, possess a kind of melancholic glow, evocative of samba, wine, and the "uninhibited" women of his homeland. </p><p> He reminisces lyrically about Paris, Italy, and Algiers, where he lived and designed projects for much of the period during which Brazil was under a repressive dictatorship. But even amid his delight in world travel, his homesickness is apparent. "I want to watch the stars / I want to feel life / And be back in Brazil / That's where I want to live," goes a characteristically openhearted poem he wrote in those years of near-forced exile. It is the land and the people of his beloved Brazil, much more so than any or all of what he designed there or elsewhere, that make up the soul of this unconventional and thoroughly lovely memoir from one of the 20th century's most talented, and passionate, architects. <i>--Timothy Murphy</i></p>Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer (b.1907) is one of the great architectural masters of the twentieth century and a pioneer of Modernism. Although Niemeyer has designed hundreds of striking and remarkably visionary buildings and masterplans during his career of six decades, he is known primarily for his role as chief architect for Brasilia and his extended collaborations with Le Corbusier. Today Niemeyer is admired for his highly inventive, organic forms that reinterpret the austerity of European Modernism.</p><h2>Ships of Mercy: The True Story of the Rescue of the Greeks, Smyrna, September 1922</h2><p>According to Greek tradition, the US and its World War I allies ordered the Greek army to invade Turkey, then abandoned it when the Turks fought back. When the Turkish army had driven the Greek army from the town of Smyrna, Greek women, children, and elderly men who had lived there fled to the quay, where they waiting for the entire month of September 1922 while American ships in the harbor refused to help them. Having semi-retired from a career in business, second-generation Greek-American Papoutsy began investigating, and found a story worth telling.

Born in 1918, L'Engle grew up in New York City, Switzerland, South Carolina and Massachusetts. Her father was a reporter and her mother had studied to be a pianist, and their house was always full of musicians and theater people. L'Engle graduated cum laude from Smith College, then returned to New York to work in the theater. While touring with a play, she wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain</i>, originally published in 1945. She met her future husband, Hugh Franklin, when they both appeared in <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>. </p><p>Upon becoming Mrs. Franklin, L'Engle gave up the stage in favor of the typewriter. In the years her three children were growing up, she wrote four more novels. Hugh Franklin temporarily retired from the theater, and the family moved to western Connecticut and for ten years ran a general store. Her book <i>Meet the Austins</i>, an American Library Association Notable Children's Book of 1960, was based on this experience. </p><p>Her science fantasy classic <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was awarded the 1963 Newbery Medal. Two companion novels, <i>A Wind in the Door</i> and <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</i> (a Newbery Honor book), complete what has come to be known as The Time Trilogy, a series that continues to grow in popularity with a new generation of readers. Her 1980 book <i>A Ring of Endless Light</i> won the Newbery Honor. L'Engle passed away in 2007 in Litchfield, Connecticut.</p>&nbsp; 1 <br>I KNEW AS SOON AS I GOT HOME on Wednesday that Jacques was there with my mother. I knew it when I walked into the entrance hall of the apartment and the door�man said, &#x201c;Good afternoon, Miss Camilla,&#x201d; and smiled at me with the eager and curious smile for which I had begun to look each time I came home. I walked across the hall, and prayed that Jacques would go now that I was home, that he would go before my father came. And I was glad that I had come straight home after school instead of going for a walk with Luisa. <br>I stepped into the elevator and the elevator boy said, as though he had something exotic-tasting in his mouth, &#x201c;Good afternoon, Miss Camilla. You have company upstairs.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br>The elevator boy is small and fat and, though he has white hair and two of his teeth are missing and show black gaps in his mouth, he is always called the elevator boy; never the elevator man. And the way his eyes are always dancing with something malicious in them when he talks makes him seem much more like the brothers of some of the girls at school than like a grown person. His eyes had that nasty hap�piness in them now, as though he were about to put out a foot and trip me up and then roar with laughter when he saw me fall on my face. <br>&#x201c;That Mr. Nissen is upstairs,&#x201d; he said, grinning. &#x201c;He asked especially if you was in and then he said he&#x2019;d go up�stairs and wait for you.&#x201d; <br>Yes, I could hear in my mind&#x2019;s ear how Jacques would ask for me, smiling and speaking in that voice of his as soft as a spaniel&#x2019;s ear. Yes, I am the one Jacques always asks for. I am like a game between Jacques and the doorman and the old elevator boy, a ball they throw back and forth between them, always smiling, smiling, as though they all understand the game is quite unimportant . . . <br>So the elevator boy looked at me with that giggly look and stopped the elevator at the fourteenth floor. It is really the thirteenth .oor, but I have noticed that in most apartment houses they just skip thirteen and call it fourteen. This is silly. You can change the number but you can&#x2019;t change the floor. <br>I said good-bye to the elevator boy and pulled my key out of the pocket of my navy blue coat and let myself into the apartment. I could hear their voices from the living room. My mother was laughing, high and excited and happy. Don&#x2019;t ever let my father hear her laugh like that, I begged, but I don&#x2019;t know to whom I was begging, my mother, or Jacques, or God. <br>I went down the hall to my room and hung up my coat and my red beret and put my schoolbooks down on the desk. Then I did not sit down and start my homework as I usually do when I get in, but went back toward the living room so that Jacques would be sure to know I was home. I walked heavily, clumping my school shoes down on the silver-green carpet so that he would know before I got to the living room. Then I knocked. <br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; my mother said. &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s you, Camilla, dar�ling. How was school? I was saying to Jacques how well you always&#x2014;your last report card was really&#x2014;your father and I are most pleased with your progress.&#x201d; <br>My mother always talks in little rushes, as though she were in such a hurry to say everything that there isn&#x2019;t time ever quite to .nish a sentence. Her voice sounds like a brook leaping and tumbling downhill, and broken up and divided by all shapes and sizes of rocks. <br>I went over to my mother and kissed her and then I shook hands with Jacques. My mother said, &#x201c;Good heavens, Camilla, your cheek is like ice. Is it raining or&#x2014; Do you think it will snow tonight, Jacques, it&#x2019;s really time&#x2014; Of course I don&#x2019;t like snow in the city after&#x2014; But then it&#x2019;s lovely while it&#x2019;s falling.&#x201d; And then she laughed. I don&#x2019;t know quite what the laugh meant, but I think she just feels free to laugh because she thinks I am so young that I am still like a kitten with eyes that aren&#x2019;t ready to open yet. But when you are .f�teen you have passed that stage. Fifteen is a strange number of years to be; it is so convenient for my mother and father that I am .fteen because they can always say that I am too young or too old whenever they want to say no about any�thing. Luisa is sixteen and she says it is the same way with her; you lose all the privileges of being a child and get none of the privileges of being grown-up. <br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, Camilla,&#x201d; Jacques said, in that silky way of his. And he looked at my mother. &#x201c;Yes, Rose, it must have started to rain. Am I right, Camilla?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; I pulled my hand out of his. He did not open his .ngers but held his hand over mine so that I felt his palm all the way as I slid my .ngers out. <br>&#x201c;Your lashes are wet,&#x201d; Jacques said, &#x201c;and there is rain in your hair. I brought you a present, Camilla.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, Camilla, do look at&#x2014; Jacques brought you a lovely&#x2014; Yes, Jacques came to&#x2014;he dropped by just for you&#x2014;to bring you a present.&#x201d; <br>Jacques went to the table that stood under the Carroll portrait of my mother and picked up a package like a small cof.n. He gave it to me. &#x201c;Perhaps you are too old for this, Camilla,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but your mother tells me you are learning to sew this year and&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, Camilla is learning to sew so beautifully&#x2014;it will be lovely for her to practice on&#x2014;all the little dresses and per�haps even some hats&#x2014;&#x201d; my mother cried, her voice high and excited. <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to open it?&#x201d; my mother asked me. <br>I opened the package. It was a doll. A large doll with real hair and long black eyelashes and horrible staring blue eyes that rolled in its head as well as opening and closing. And as I lifted it up its tiny rosy mouth opened and there were two rows of cruel little white teeth. I have never liked dolls. Somehow they have always frightened me a little because they are like cartoons of all that is cold and unloving and un�caring in people. <br>&#x201c;You see? She has lashes like yours, Camilla. And she&#x2019;s&#x2014; she&#x2019;s really not just a doll for a child, you know.&#x201d; He seemed suddenly nervous and he pushed his .ngers quickly over his hair, which is thick and wavy and almost as fair as my mother&#x2019;s. <br>The doll&#x2019;s head lolled against my arm and the round, pink mouth closed in a sneer. <br>&#x201c;How about your schoolwork&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you have home�work to do, Camilla? All that Latin&#x2014;and is it geometry you were asking your father to&#x2014; I never could understand geom�etry,&#x201d; my mother said. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said to my mother. &#x201c;Thank you very much for the doll,&#x201d; I said to Jacques. <br>I left the room and walked down the hall again. I put the doll down on a chair and it fell over so that it lay with its head on the arm of the chair like a midget who was drunk. Then I remembered I had left the box and the wrappings on the table under my mother&#x2019;s portrait, so I went back to the living room and this time I did not knock. I don&#x2019;t know whether I did this on purpose or not, but when I walked into the room, there were Jacques and my mother kissing, as I had known they would be. <br>&#x201c;I forgot the box the doll came in,&#x201d; I said in a loud voice and went over to the table. <br>Jacques opened his mouth to say something and closed it and then he opened it again and I think that this time he re�ally would have said something, only then we were all frozen into silence by the sound of my father&#x2019;s key in the lock. <br>We heard my father come in and the soft thud as he tossed his hat on the hall table and his coat on the chair for Carter, the maid, to pick up. Then my mother went over to the sofa and sat down in front of the coffee table and lit a cigarette. <br>Her .ngers were as pale and thin as the cigarette and they were trembling. Jacques lit a cigarette, too, and his .ngers were not trembling at all. <br>My father came into the room and he had a tight smile on his face that did not change when he saw Jacques but simply became a little more tight, the way the braces on my teeth feel when I have just been to the dentist. <br>&#x201c;Good evening, Rafferty, my love,&#x201d; my mother said, and squashed out her unsmoked cigarette in an ashtray. The ciga�rette crumpled and then broke and little bits of tobacco stuck out from the tear. &#x201c;Camilla says it&#x2019;s raining. Did you get&#x2014; Hadn&#x2019;t you better change your shoes if&#x2014; Or has it stopped?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still raining,&#x201d; my father said, and he leaned across the coffee table and kissed my mother. Then he nodded to Jacques. &#x201c;Evening.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What time is&#x2014;or are you early?&#x201d; my mother asked him. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m early,&#x201d; my father said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking very lovely this evening, Rose.&#x201d; Then he smiled that tight smile at me, as though it hurt him to move his mouth. &#x201c;What have you got there, Camilla?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A box,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;And what is the purpose of the box?&#x201d; My father leaned over the coffee table again, took a cigarette from the silver box, and handed it to my mother. Then he pulled out his lighter and lit it for her. All the while he said nothing and looked at her and she looked back at him with the blue eyes of the doll. And my father seemed to grow until he .lled up the whole room, standing by the coffee table in his dark suit, his cigarette lighter still .aring in his outstretched hand. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a box a doll came in,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;A doll?&#x201d; <br>Now I knew that Jacques and my mother were glad I had come back into the room when I did. My mother said, &#x201c;Jacques brought Camilla a doll. Jacques is Camilla&#x2019;s most ardent admirer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And where is the doll?&#x201d; my father asked. &#x201c;Really, Rose, why on earth would anyone give a doll to Camilla? She&#x2019;s not a child anymore.&#x201d; <br>This was the .rst time I had ever heard my father be rude to anyone, and it startled me. I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in my room. I came back to get the box.&#x201d; I looked at Jacques and then at my mother and then at my father. My father is a very large man. He is tall and broad and his body is as solid as a stone. His hair is as strong and de.nite as black marble and the streaks of white that touch his temples are like the markings in mar�ble. His shoulders are as broad as the shoulders on the statue of Atlas on Fifth Avenue near Rockefeller Center, the one who is holding up the world and looks as though he is slip�ping off his pedestal from the weight of it. But my father&#x2019;s foot would not slip. <br>&#x201c;Fix you a drink, Nissen?&#x201d; my father asked. <br>&#x201c;Thanks&#x2014;no,&#x201d; Jacques murmured. &#x201c;I must be going. I have an appointment downtown.&#x201d; <br>I did not wait to hear him say good-bye but slipped out of the living room and went back to my room. I turned off the light. At .rst I could not see anything; for a moment it was like being blind, but then the light came in through my win�dow from the lighted windows of the apartments across the court. I pushed the curtains aside and looked out. When I was much younger I used to think that living on the court was like living partway down the rabbit&#x2019;s hole in Alice&#x2019;s Adven�tures in Wonderland. Sometimes Luisa and I will stand by the window and watch it grow dark and tell each other things about the people who live in the other apartments. Or I will try on clear winter nights to show Luisa the stars. You have to lean far out and look up through the rabbit&#x2019;s hole of build�ings to see them, but when it is very cold and clear I can point out Aldebaran and Betelgeuse, Bellatrix and Sirius, the Pleiades and Perseus. <br>Three sides of the court that form the rabbit&#x2019;s hole are made up of the big apartment house in which I live. The fourth side is a smaller, lower apartment house, and I can see the roof where there is a big tank with a ladder going up to it, but which I have never seen anybody climb. It is across this roof that I can .nd the most stars. Sometimes on warm days young women will come up onto the roof in bathing suits and spread blankets out and lie in the sun, and in the evening they will come up with young men and watch the moon rise above the broken edges of the city and kiss the way I saw my mother and Jacques kiss. The rooms in this smaller building are different from the ones in our house. They are more clut�tered and the people don&#x2019;t bother to pull down their shades or close their venetian blinds as often and there are fewer maids turning on lamps and lighting candles on mahogany ta�bles and bustling around kitchens in the evenings. There is something very comforting about kitchens. It always cheers me up to stand by my bedroom window and watch dinner being cooked and imagine things about happy families with lots of children. <br>I stood there at my window after I had left my mother and father and Jacques saying good-bye, and looked through the veil of falling rain into a big kitchen in the smaller house where a whole family, mother and father and four children and a grandmother, too, were sitting around a big blue kitchen table eating scrambled eggs and bacon for supper. Then my door opened and I heard my father&#x2019;s voice. <br>&#x201c;Camilla.&#x201d; <br>I turned around and he was standing, almost .lling up the doorway, outlined in warm yellow light from the hall. <br>&#x201c;Here I am, Father,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;What are you doing all alone in the dark?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just looking at the rain.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a melancholy business,&#x201d; my father said. &#x201c;Turn on your light and put on one of your pretty dresses and come out to dinner with me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Your mother has a headache,&#x201d; my father said, &#x201c;so she&#x2019;s going to bed to have tea and toast, and I thought it might be fun for us to go out cavorting together. How about it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; I moved away from the window and turned on the light by my desk, blinking against its sharpness. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you half an hour to primp in, and then we&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d; My father gave me a clumsy pat on the shoulder and left me. <br>I went into the bathroom and took a shower and brushed my teeth. Brushing my teeth is a nuisance because of my braces, though it&#x2019;s easier now that the outside ones are off and I just have them on the inside. While I was brushing my teeth my mother came to the bathroom door in a rose velvet negligee and said, &#x201c;Camilla darling, when you&#x2019;re dressed, come to my room and&#x2014;heavens, darling, you&#x2019;ve got tooth�paste all over your face&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll .x your hair for you and you can use some of my makeup.&#x201d; Her face was puckered with anxiety and her eyelashes were just a little damp and stuck-together-looking, as though she had started to cry and then decided against it. Her pale hair was tumbled about her shoulders and it looked softer and more luxuriant than the velvet of her gown. &#x201c;All right, Camilla darling?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All right, Mother,&#x201d; I said, and started to put the top back on the toothpaste. It slipped out of my .ngers and rolled like a little round black beetle down the slippery sides of the washbasin and into the drain, where I had to .sh and .sh for it with my .ngers; and all the while my mother stood there in the doorway, looking as though she was about to burst into tears, and watched me. <br>&#x201c;You can use my tweezers, darling, to get that nasty top if you&#x2014; Really, they&#x2019;re lots easier than your .ngers.&#x201d; But just then I got the top out and rinsed it off and put it back on the toothpaste. <br>My mother turned to go, saying as she left, &#x201c;Do hurry now, darling, and don&#x2019;t keep your father&#x2014; Rafferty hates to be kept waiting.&#x201d; <br>I washed my face again to make sure I got all the tooth�paste off and went back to my room and dressed. I put on the sheer smoky stockings my mother had given me for my birth�day and which I had never worn before and a dress she had bought me that is neither silver nor green, and that changes color as you move in it. It is a very beautiful dress and the one dress-up thing that I have that I really like and don&#x2019;t feel strange and uncomfortable in. Luisa gets annoyed at me be�cause I care about clothes, but I love pretty things when they seem right for me. <br>When I went into my mother&#x2019;s room she was lying on her chaise longue with a soft blanket over her knees, but she got &nbsp;<br>Excerpted from Camilla by Madeleine l&#x2019;Engle.<br>Copyright � 2009 by...</p><h2>Minnie&#39;s Sacrifice, Sowing and Reaping, Trial and Triumph: Three Rediscovered Novels</h2><p>Winner of the College Language Association Book Award<br><br>Frances Smith Foster has rediscovered three novels by Frances E. W. Harper, the best-known African-American writer of the nineteenth century and author of the classic Iola Leroy. Originally serialized in issues of <i>The Christian Recorder</i> between 1868 and 1888, these works address issues of passing, social responsibility, courtship, sexuality, and temperance, and are the first to have been written specifically for an African-American audience.</p><p>Frances Smith Foster, professor of literature at the University of California, San Diego, and well-known scholar of nineteenth-century African-American literature, is author of <i>Witnessing Slavery: The Development of Ante-Bellum Slave Narratives</i>.&lt;Through her highly moral and socially responsible characters, a 19th-century African-American writer presents a broad, lively range of political and personal views about being treated as America's second-class citizens. These three novels, originally serialized in the mid-to-late- 1800s in Christian Recorder (the journal of the African Methodist Episcopal Church), were recently rediscovered by editor Foster (Literature/Univ. of California, San Diego) while doing research on Harper. The eponymous heroine of Minnie's Sacrifice is a young woman of mixed race spirited away from the South and raised in the North by a gentle, loving Quaker couple. Her true racial heritage is kept from her until one day her escaped slave mother surprises her on the street. Minnie marries Louis, who has also been ignorant of his mixed race parentage; after the war they bravely live in the South to work for the personal and economic uplifting and empowerment of their race--until tragedy strikes. Sowing and Reaping is a paean to the virtues of avoiding the decadence of drink; it uses contrasting pairs of friends--frivolous Jeanette and Charles, steady Belle and Paul--to tell a story of temperance and self-destruction. In Trial and Triumph, Annette Harcourt moves through a lonely childhood and awkward adolescence to become a beloved teacher and poet in her community, finding love only after years of hard work and sacrifice. Foster has ably edited and introduced the novels, putting in context melodramatic plots and highly stylized language that may seem dated or off-putting to some readers. An important addition to 19th-century American literature, addressing weighty questions of race, community, and citizenship that are still being posed today. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His crowning achievement, <i>Leviathan,</i> remains among the greatest works in the history of ideas. Written during a moment in English history when the political and social structures as well as methods of science were in flux and open to interpretation, <i>Leviathan</i> played an essential role in the development of the modern world.<br>An outspoken royalist, Hobbes fled to France during the English civil war, where he wrote this polemic, in which he calls for a powerful sovereign &#x2014; a "Leviathan" &#x2014; to act as an enforcer of peace and justice. Hobbes' articulation of this long-contemplated philosophy of political and natural science was finally published in 1651, two years after the overthrow and execution of Charles I. It met with a firestorm of controversy that included charges of treason and sedition. This edition of Hobbes' landmark work is based on the original text. It incorporates the author's own corrections and retains the period spelling and punctuation, offering both flavorful authenticity and the utmost clarity of expression.</p><p>Hobbes&#39; Leviathan is arguably the greatest piece of political philosophy written in the English language. Richard Tuck&#39;s edition has been recognized as the single most accurate and authoritative text since its publication.

Spirituality. &#34;Money is energy that should flow freely through our lives and throughout the world. But fear blocks the flow. Fear is like a dam. Hoarding, greed, belief in lack and scarcity are all elements of fear, and together they create a great dam that backs up the flow.&#34; (&#34;Introduction&#34;) MONEY IS LOVE is an extended essay about money from a spiritual and practical perspective. A long time teacher of light-energy healing and personal transformation Barbara Wilder has been teaching &#34;Money is Love&#34; since 1998. Includes a bibliography.</p><p>Barbara Wilder began studying the metaphysics of money the moment she got her first allowance. From the beginning money both fascinated and repelled her. Educated as an actress, dancer and writer, to her dismay and amazement she found herself supporting her son by working as an accountant on motion pictures; a job that required her to handle enormous sums of cash daily. Fast on the heals of her new career was the beginning of her spiritual education in The School of Actualism, an hermetic mystery school, where she studied for eleven years. Soon she began to uncover the inherent truths in money and its use in spiritual lesson learning. Actualism taught that abundance and goodwill lived harmoniously on the same metaphysical band of energy. From that point it was only a matter of time before Barbara would come to understand that money could be used as a tool for healing, eventually being transformed into love. Barbara, a long time teacher of light-energy healing and personal transformation has been teaching &#34;Money is Love&#34; since early 1998."A searchlight into the dark mystery of wealth, MONEY IS LOVE illuminates unexamined terrain. Seekers of balance in this material life, start here to remember the true power in your cash flow. A challenging and fun way to change your mind about money." -- <i>Dennis Robertson, C.E.O., Ashoka Credit Union</i><br><br>"Barbara has created a simple, hands-on approach to cleaning up our relationship to money on both a personal and global scale. This book provides useful truths from history, healing techniques, and a clear vision that can shift our perceptions about money from fear and greed to love and goodwill. MONEY IS LOVE is a great place to start in bringing greater abundance to our pocketbooks and a little peace of mind to our souls." -- <i>Tim Clauss, Co-author of CHICKEN SOUP FOR THE SOUL AT WORK</i></p><h2>Fast Sailing Ships: Their Design and Construction, 1775-1875</h2><p>Shipped from UK, please allow 10 to 21 business days for arrival.

Since then he has worked mainly in the theatre, but has also starred in One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, created the part of Norman in The Dresser on both stage and screen, performed solo in the brilliant Russian dissident play Moscow Stations in Edinburgh, London and New York, created the role of Serge in the original West End production of Art and played King Lear at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester. His latest film is Last Orders? He was knighted in the 2001 New Year&#39;s Honours List. Dear Tom is his first book.In this celebrity era where you just kick a ball a couple of times for England and out pops an autobiography, it is perhaps surprising that someone as distinguished as Courtenay, who helped to define an epoch through films such as Billy Liar, hasn&#39;t already written one. Dear Tom goes at least some way to redress that. The bulk of the book comprises letters sent by his mother when he left his native Hull for UCL and RADA. It stops at the point when he attracted widespread and glowing press notices in seasons at The Old Vic . Effectively it&#39;s a tribute to her and shatters any well-worn myths about growing up in a post-war working class northern family: No &#34;trouble at mill&#34; here, more the tale of a woman whose active desire to improve her lot proved to be a major influence on the young Tom. Although the letters are warm and touching, the disappointment is that Courtenay does not attempt a fuller account of his life from his own perspective to accompany them.</p><h2>Ford Ka (96-08).

That is, until the Psychic Parrot takes up residence in the school library and threatens to overturn Mudshark&#x2019;s position as the guy who knows all the answers. The word in school is that the parrot can out-think Mudshark. And right now, the school needs someone who&#x2019;s good at solving problems. There&#x2019;s an escaped gerbil running rampant, an emergency in the faculty restroom, and all the erasers are disappearing from the classrooms.<br><br>When Mudshark solves the mystery of who&#x2019;s stealing the erasers, he discovers the culprit has the best of intentions.

He relishes reading and observing the world as much as he enjoys sports, and his memory for finding lost articles wins him the prestige of unofficial school detective. The inevitable trouble in paradise occurs when the librarian's psychic parrot threatens his reputation. Mudshark decides that he can simultaneously neutralize the bird and solve a missing-eraser problem with a little help from a wacky assortment of classmates. The principal's intercom announcements that introduce each chapter may cause teary-eyed chortles ("Please refrain from forming hunting parties to hunt the gerbil"). Paulsen presents readers with the unabashedly entertaining machinations of Mudshark, lone bastion of sanity in the midst of school chaos. Fresh and light with scads of humor, this is a tale that doesn't take itself too seriously. That said, the episodes of school-borne mischief hit their target audience just right.

Be not afraid. Erudite and detailed without being pedantic, Happiness is lively, lucid and enjoyable. Darrin M. McMahon's history of happiness concentrates on the great books of the Western world. From ancient Greek tragedies' portrayal of happiness as a gift of the gods, through Roman celebrations of everyday comforts and pleasures, the medieval Christian focus on eternal bliss, and the modern conviction that earthly happiness is not just a right but practically a duty, McMahon traces the way conceptions of happiness have changed. The author, a professor of history at Florida State University, demonstrates "not only the centrality of the issue of happiness to the Western tradition, but the centrality of that same tradition and legacy to contemporary concerns." His book abounds with intriguing material. For example, it shows how G.K. Chesterton's aphorism "The world is full of Christian ideas gone mad" applies to happiness: Just as Christianity promises heaven, various secular thinkers came to promise heaven on earth -- earthly happiness -- to those who followed the true path. Conversely, McMahon points out that "the church could scarcely fail to present [its eternal] reward in terms that appealed directly to the senses. Beatitude would satisfy our hunger, quench our thirst, gratify all our longings." In the theology of St. Thomas Aquinas, in heaven "the saved will literally be drunk on God." Some Christian mystics even described divine rapture in such "frankly erotic terms" as "the cleaving to the breast of Mary and the taking in of her warm milk." Readers may be tempted to conclude that Christianity is full of worldly ideas gone mad. Also noteworthy is McMahon's observation that traditionally, "a life of privilege was a life without labor ....That men and women should come to believe -- even to expect -- that work ... should sustain their happiness, serving as a source of satisfaction in its own right, is therefore a recent and quite remarkable development." McMahon displays his gift for nimble commentary by adding that it is "one of the delicious ironies of history" that "Marx's contention that not only should we enjoy the fruits of our labor, but labor itself should be our fruit, is today a central tenet of the capitalist creed." Another particularly delightful exhibition of this knack is his reference to the bourgeoisie as "that amorphous group against whom Romantics and revolutionaries alike constantly railed, even as they freely accepted their funds." The book is further enriched by numerous well-chosen illustrations, including an amusing photograph of an adornment of a bakery in Pompeii. The photograph shows the image of a penis, accompanied by the words "Hic Habitat Felicitas" -- here dwells happiness. McMahon's discussion is generally excellent, sympathetic without being uncritical, but occasionally he falters. When considering Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, he criticizes our own society for resembling Huxley's fictional one in that people are "encouraged wherever possible to eradicate the unpleasant rather 'than learning to put up with it.'" But our society has diverse voices, so many of which discourage hedonism that McMahon's criticism is rather hackneyed. In his account of Romanticism, he calls it "a truth" that "suffering [is] necessary to educate the self, to make us more complete human beings." So it is hardly surprising that he accepts Huxley's supposition that in a society where everything is pleasurable, life is bound to revolve around superficial sensory thrills, mindless entertainment and material consumption. This debatable supposition cries out for the balanced and nuanced treatment McMahon gives most of the ideas he discusses. The same point applies to McMahon's uncritical endorsement of the outlook of University of Chicago ethicist Leon R. Kass, the former chair of the Bush administration's Council on Bioethics. This endorsement ignores the reasons why Kass's conservative views are objectionable to many. McMahon maintains that "there is a critical difference between aiming to alleviate senseless suffering and striving to overcome [what Freud called] 'ordinary unhappiness.'" Senseless suffering should be assuaged, he argues, but ordinary unhappiness should be accepted as "inherent to being human." Accordingly, he echoes Kass's antipathy to using medical science " 'beyond therapy' -- beyond, that is, 'the usual domain of medicine and the goals of healing'" to overcome ordinary unhappiness. But McMahon's own recognition that "there is, and can be ... no objective standard of what it is to feel normal, to experience a 'typical' human balance between pleasure and pain" calls the distinction between "senseless suffering" and "ordinary happiness" into question. Furthermore, McMahon's clich�d claim that humans who would manipulate "our genes to enhance our happiness" would "be leaving a piece of their humanity behind" should be assessed in light of a recent suggestion by technology pioneer Ray Kurzweil: The essence of being human lies not in our limitations but in our ability to transcend them. Again, a much more balanced treatment is needed. Fortunately, the book's strengths far outweigh its flaws. Although McMahon neither promises nor delivers the secret of happiness, his book can bring readers the satisfaction of intellectual adventure.

All Rights Reserved.Before the contemporary onslaught of therapeutic treatments and self-help guidance, the very idea of happiness in this life was virtually unknown. In this eminently readable work, McMahon (<i>Enemies of Enlightenment</i>) looks back through 2,000 years of thought, searching for evidence of how our contemporary obsession came to be. From the tragic plays of ancient Greece to the inflammatory rhetoric of Rousseau and Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, McMahon delves deeply into the rich trove of texts that elucidate and confirm the development of Western notions of this elusive ideal. In one particularly rousing section, he highlights the breakthrough thinking of German theologian and religious revolutionary Martin Luther. Locked in self-imposed exile in the Augustine Black Monastery in Wittenberg, Luther struggled with a God who punished sinners, then realized that man is "justified&#x2014;made just, not punished with justice..." and that this life was one to be lived, that man must "drink more, engage in sports and recreation, aye, even sin a little" in order to be happy. Throughout McMahon leads the reader with strong, clear thinking, laying out his ideas with grace, both challenging and entertaining us in equal measure. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Narrated by Kovacic as a ten-year-old boy, he describes his family's journey with uncanny naivet�. Before leaving their home, he imagines his father's home country as something beautiful out of a fairytale, but as they make their way toward exile, he and his family realize that any attempt to make a home in Slovenia will be in vain.

Hall intro. Taylor</p><p></p><h2>The Shield of Achilles : War, Peace and the Course of History</h2><p>This ambitious book sets out to reinterpret the history of the twentieth century as a long war in which conditions of outright military confrontation or of frantic &#39;cold&#39; competition lasted from the outbreak of the first world war until the collapse of the Soviet Union. He goes on to argue that this long experience of war has brought about a fundamental change in the constitutional basis of states, and explores this idea through the notion of the &#39;market state&#39;. By clarifying the relationship between constitutional settlements and military power, and by drawing on his firsthand experience in the heart of superpower planning, Bobbitt reveals a startling new way of understanding the past - and an awesome glimpse of the future.</p><p>The scope of Philip Bobbitt's <i>The Shield of Achilles</i> is breathtaking: the interplay, over the last six centuries, among war, jurisprudence, and the reshaping of countries ("states," in Bobbitt's vocabulary). Bobbitt posits that certain wars should be deemed epochal--that is, seen as composed of many "smaller" wars. For example, according to Bobbitt the epochal war of the 20th century began in 1914 and ended with the collapse of communism in 1990. These military affairs--and their subsequent "ultimate" peace agreements--have caused, each in their own way, revolutionary reconstructions of the idea and actuality of statehood and, following, of relationships between these various new entities. Of these reconstructions (including the princely state, the kingly state, and the nation-state), Bobbitt is most interested in the current incarnation, which he calls the market-state: one whose borders are scuffed and hazy at best (certainly compared to earlier territorial markers) and whose strengths, weaknesses, citizens, and enemies roam across cyberspace rather than plains and valleys. <i>The Shield of Achilles</i> is massive, erudite, and demanding--at once highly abstract and extremely detailed. There is about it an air of detached erudition, one noticeably free of the easy "decline and fall" hysteria too often present in contemporary historical analyses. <i>--H.

Ironically, while the great military exploits of General Stonewall Jackson are studied in military schools the world over and his iron will and stern self-discipline have become legendary, little is said about his remarkable marriage. The real Thomas J. Jackson was a humble Christian and loving husband and father. The tender and instructive letters he wrote to his wife Anna are a model of godly leadership and covenantal faithfulness. From their courtship to their final days together, trace the true story of this remarkable couple through the letters of General Jackson to his bride. Even in the midst of the most arduous military campaigns, Stonewall took the time to send home extensive letters of love and devotion.

And nowhere is this sense more alive than in the desolation of the cubicle. In Dilbert&#39;s world, cubicle dwellers are relegated to everything from the half-size intern cubicle to the patented head cubicle and are even sentenced to adopt and decorate empty cubicles.* Dilbert continues to be the voice for the embattled cubicle-dwelling Everyman. With best-friend Dogbert, and a veritable who&#39;s who in accompanying office characters ranging from the Boss and Wally to Alice and Catbert, Dilbert offers a welcome dose of laughter in response to the inanity of corporate culture and middle-management mores.</p><p>Scott Adams was born in Windham, NY, and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1979.

From the moment he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1972, he has been a leader in the conservative movement that has changed the course of the nation. From his years in Congress to his ascent to majority leader of the Senate -- and his decision to leave that post in the heat of controversy -- <strong>Herding Cats</strong> is the frank and revealing chronicle of a unique political life.</p><p>Lott's story bridges an extraordinary time in American history. As a fraternity leader during the integration of the University of Mississippi, he helped contain the violence that accompanied James Meredith's enrollment as the university's first African American student. As a congressman during Watergate, he mounted a fierce defense of Richard Nixon -- until Gerald Ford quietly counseled him to think twice. A passionate advocate of smaller government, Lott describes his painful choice to support Gerald Ford over his challenger Ronald Reagan in the 1976 election -- and his delight in helping lead the revolution that followed Reagan's win in 1980.</p><p>Yet it was in his dramatic engagements with the Clinton administration that Lott found his greatest victories -- and challenges. Working in secret through political adviser Dick Morris, Lott reveals, he persuaded Clinton to accept health insurance and welfare reform laws, along with spending cuts that balanced the national budget. But he was aghast when years of work on a tobacco settlement were scuttled by the White House in 1997 -- possibly because of Al Gore's desire to exploit tobacco as a political issue. With surprising candor, Lott portrays his fruitful working partnership with Democratic leader Tom Daschle during the Clinton impeachment, and again in the hours after the attacks of September 11, 2001. And he describes in painful detail his decision to resign as majority leader after his remarks at Senator Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party -- a move he made when it became clear that the Bush White House had circled the wagons against him.</p><p>Marked by the same straight-talking style and good humor he has shown throughout his career in public service, Trent Lott's <strong>Herding Cats</strong> is the memoir of a true master of American political life.</p></p><p><p>Trent Lott is the junior senator from Mississippi. He currently chairs both the Rules and Administration Committee and the Surface Transportation Subcommittee and serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Finance Committee. He lives with his family in Washington, D.C., and Pascagoula, Mississippi.</p></p><h2>Carefree Gardening</h2><p>A new edition of this book describing how the author and her husband created a garden out of a wilderness at their home at East Lambrook Manor in Somerset.

Rosen was also one of the first to study in detail the philosophical significance of the phenomenon of concrete human sexuality, as it is presented by Plato in the diverse characters of the main speakers in the dialogue. His analysis of the theoretical significance of pederasty in the dialogue was highly controversial at the time, but is today accepted as central to Plato's dramatic phenomenology of human existence.<p>Rosen discusses a variety of topics that had previously been neglected in the secondary literature, including the problem of the hybristic nature of the philosopher, the poetical dimension of Plato's conception of philosophy, and the theoretical implication of the difference between Platonic writing and Socratic conversation.</p></p><p>"Recent years have seen a small but steady flow of major studies in the Platonic dialogues, marked by a marriage of scholarly thoroughness with genuine humanistic warmth. This volume is one such. . . . A wealth of linguistic and cultural lore pertaining to ancient Greece. . . . This book must be in every college library." -- <i>Choice</i><br><br>"Rosen treats the Symposium very much from the literary point of view. He has . . . perceptive observations to make on the dramatic elements in Plato's style, on his use of irony, and on his characterizations." -- <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"Rosen's book is strikingly different from most English writing on Plato. The volume is beautifully produced, and contains an extensive and useful bibliography." -- <i>H. J. Easterling, Classical Review</i><br><br>"This exciting book . . . contains much to reflect upon. The author possesses a good knowledge of ancient texts but does not hesitate to provide very instructive references to modern philosophy. . . . One may say of this book what the author says of the Platonic dialogue as compared to a poem or a set of axioms: no description is equivalent to its content or it implications." -- <i>Rmi Brague, Revue Philosophique de Louvain</i><br><br>"[H]ighly intelligent and . . . stimulating book." -- <i>Trevor J.

After 10 years of studying volume upon volume, Zulberg distilled the teachings of humanity's greatest doctors and philosophers&#x2014;what he calls the Master Physicians&#x2014;and discovered something amazing: Ancient doctors already knew what today's medical findings are rediscovering about what's best for human health, weight loss, disease prevention, and psychological well-being. On <i>The 5 Skinny Habits</i> diet plan, you'll harness the best of both worlds&#x2014;the ancient and the modern&#x2014;for long-term success.<br><br><i>The 5 Skinny Habits</i> explains the ancient understanding of health and its application to our lives in the 21st century with its supersize proportions. There are no forbidden foods or food groups, and you can even enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. Through a close study of ancient sources written by the Master Physicians, Zulberg integrates the spiritual, emotional, and physical components of health and weight loss. Habit changes are at the core of the program. With an easy five-step plan, Zulberg tells readers how to incorporate one habit each week for 5 weeks to achieve a healthier life. His five steps streamline and simplify the process of becoming fit, ensuring that change is made for good. A simple diet diary with positive affirmations and mindfulness makes self-monitoring an effective and enjoyable part of the discovery. By the end of the journey, readers have incorporated the habits into their routines so completely that they are no longer "dieting" but simply living a healthier life.</p><p>David Zulberg is considered one of the foremost experts in Maimonides&#39; medical works. Zulberg holds a Masters from Columbia University and is an ACE-certified fitness specialist and health coach.CHAPTER 1<br><br>Listen to Your Body<br><br>You should eat only when you are hungry and drink only when you are thirsty.<br><br>&#x2014;MAIMONIDES<br><br>Health and Nutrition: The 5 Skinny Habits plan is based on time-tested, ancient nutritional and psychological principles, rooted in the teachings of the Master Physicians. I specifically call them principles rather than rules because you will not feel restricted by them. You will be empowered to choose how to eat. In addition to the principles our system incorporates the most current nutritional and fitness scientific guidelines. On the 5 Skinny Habits, you'll harness the best of both worlds--the ancient and the modern--for longterm success. You will have the flexibility to create your own eating patterns and exercise routine in harmony with your personal lifestyle and preferences.<br><br>Behavior Modification: Successful weight loss is not only about losing excess �ds. It's also about acquiring positive eating and lifestyle habits. The Master Physicians write explicitly that many of our bad food choices and bad eating habits originate from our perceptions. It is more than simply an issue of diet and exercise. Current research and psychologists substantiate this opinion. According to the American Psychological Association, both the body and the mind must participate in a successful weight-loss program.1<br><br>Most diets concentrate on the food itself with emphasis on outer results. After all, most people want to look better externally. The inner causative process is often ignored. But if you think about it, our actions are simply the physical manifestations of inner motivational forces. To achieve our aim of health and weight management, we need to understand how our minds are involved in our eating habits.<br><br>Moreover, most behaviors are habits that have been established over time, and we do them automatically, without resistance or much thought. You can't simply stop doing something unhealthy or change your whole routine. Sure, this may work initially and even last for a few weeks or months. But ultimately motivation wanes because the mind requires conditioning in order to change course. Unhealthy habits and behaviors must be replaced with healthy behaviors--at the right pace. If you take this approach, you will not need to rely on willpower or motivation. Through the same method that established our bad habits in the first place, healthy, productive behaviors will be set in motion and eventually done automatically, without even thinking.<br><br>Practical Process: Sometimes you can read or hear something inspirational and still fail to actually change. What happened to that powerful moment of inspiration? I know people who have voluminous information on nutrition at their fingertips, but they're still trying to lose weight and gain health! Knowledge of nutritional and psychological principles is insufficient. You need to learn how to internalize your knowledge and put it into practice on a day-to-day basis. I have formulated a precise and practical plan of action: five habits in 5 weeks. Each week has been carefully designed from both a physical and a psychological perspective.<br><br>Right Pace: The guidelines are clear, and the principles are implemented at the right pace. Statistics show that extreme diets and radical initial phases of diets usually end in disappointment. It is similar to building a house, which begins with the foundation stage. This stage can take quite some time, during which everything looks like a mess to the untrained eye. The walls have not yet been built, and the layout of the rooms cannot be seen. However, professionals know that this is the most important stage. The final construction stages and placement of the furnishings may be more thrilling, but there is no way to take a shortcut. The foundation must be firmly set in place. The process of building a house's foundation applies to the process of creating any lasting structures in life, whether physical, spiritual, or emotional. It is most certainly true about losing weight. In my opinion, ignoring this foundational stage is one of the main reasons many diets fail in the long run. These diets start off with extreme measures or phases. Although the weight loss is initially exciting and often rapid, the results don't last very long. We all know this too well from experience! Quite simply, without a strong foundation, it is only a matter of time before any structure will fall--leaving more of a mess and greater damage than there was in the beginning. If you really want to succeed in gaining health and losing weight, then you have to move at the right pace, and this is where our program shines.<br><br>LISTEN TO YOUR BODY<br><br>Stop for a moment and think of any quote you have heard or read that sums up the essence of successful weight loss and health.<br><br>My choice is a statement made by Maimonides: You should eat only when you are hungry and drink only when you are thirsty.2<br><br>It sounds so simple and obvious that it's almost laughable. Yet, in my opinion, this is the key to long-term health and weight loss. We are being told, "Listen to your body." Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Our bodies have become so accustomed to bad eating and lifestyle habits that they can no longer accurately read their cues.<br><br>Animals in their natural habitat never overeat or indulge in addictive behavior. A deer will walk calmly in front of a pack of lions that has already made its kill. The deer instinctively knows that a lion will not eat more than it needs. Yet if a piece of chocolate could walk, it would never venture close to a person, even after that person has finished a five- course meal. Do animals have more control than people?<br><br>In an experiment, a group of 3-year-olds were given large portions of macaroni. The children stopped eating when they were no longer hungry. A group of 5-year-olds continued to eat even after they were no longer hungry. Can we conclude that 3-year-olds have more control than older children?<br><br>According to Barbara Rolls, PhD, of Pennsylvania State University, learned behavior overtakes instinct between the ages of 3 and 5.3 The body would instinctively stop eating when satisfied, but we learn to choose the biggest piece of cake or to "clean" our plates.<br><br>The Master Physicians state that when you're hungry, you will want any type of food. However, when you experience a craving, it's for a specific food. Why?<br><br>When you're truly hungry, you need and want food to satisfy that hunger. It's a natural calling, and any type of food will satisfy that physiological requirement. When you have done so, you will no longer have to eat because the goal has been accomplished--your natural hunger has been satisfied. That's why an animal or a 3-year-old child instinctively stops eating when satiated. In contrast, cravings and overeating are not instinctive. You do not need that specific food you crave. They are learned behaviors, shaped over time through the intricate mechanisms of habit formation. Eventually, a "need" is born to constantly satisfy your unhealthy cravings.<br><br>The main goal of the 5 Skinny Habits is to restore your natural rhythm by reinstating the integrity of your natural internal system. Then you will eat when you are hungry and stop eating before satiation occurs--because that is what you should do naturally. You will "unlearn" negative behavioral habits and relearn how to listen to and rely on the innate ability of your body. At the point of change, you will not be overcoming your nature. You will be returning to your instinctive nature. Just like the 3-year-old child and the animal, your body will make the right choices.<br><br>If you need to lose weight, your body fat will melt away, transforming your outer appearance. You will feel healthier and more energized. Your emotional outlook will certainly improve. This system of gaining health and losing weight will become a gateway to fulfilling your multifaceted potential. Most importantly, maintaining your success will be a natural consequence of the positive habits you develop during the process of losing weight and gaining health.<br><br>I can relate very well to the challenge of losing weight and incorporating new healthy habits. I know what you're going through. Let me continue by telling you about what prompted me to change my life.<br><br>Esther, Oak Park, Michigan<br><br>Lost 95 Pounds<br><br>I wanted to thank you wholeheartedly for a weight-loss system that has helped me to create a healthier self. To date, I have lost 95 �ds, and I hope to continue applying these positive habits to my daily life. I still follow your program and exercise regularly. May God reward your efforts and may we merit living a healthy life that enhances our purpose in every area of life.</p><h2>Stalingrad 1942 (Campaign)</h2><p>Stalingrad has become a by-word for grim endurance and tenacity; for the refusal to give up, no matter the cost. In this book, Peter Antill takes a dispassionate look at one of the most talked about battles in history. He asks why the Germans allowed themselves to be diverted from their main objective, which was to capture the oil fields of the Caucasus, and concentrate such large resources on a secondary target. He discusses the merits of the commanders on both sides and also the relationship on the German side with Hitler as well as reviewing the ways in which the command structures influenced the battle. Apart from the overall question of German objectives, this book also unpicks the detail of unit directions, priorities and deployments, leading to a vivid account of the day-by-day war of attrition that took place in Stalingrad during World War II (1939-1945), between September 14, 1942 and February 2, 1943. Stalingrad was more than a turning point, it was the anvil on which the back of German military ambitions in the east were broken and the echoes of its death knell were heard in Berlin and indeed the world over.</p><p>Peter D. Antill has a background in international politics and defense studies, with a BA in International Relations from Staffordshire University and an MSc in Strategic Studies from the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. Having worked as a Research Assistant in the Department of Defence Management and Security Analysis at Cranfield from 1998 to 2002, Peter is now pursuing a career as a writer. The author lives in Wiltshire, UK.&#x201c;Peter Antill's Stalingrad 1942 discusses one of the key battles of World War II and is a top pick for any in-depth military library seeking more detailed analysis of strategies and approaches to battle. Peter Antill questions why the Germans allowed themselves to be diverted from their main objective and defeated in the Eastern Front: maps and analysis provide keys to understanding.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>California Bookwatch (August 2007)</i></p><h2>Bambi: A Life in the Woods</h2><p>To tie in with the re-release of the beloved film classic, Felix Salten&#39;s wise and beautiful novel, which was the inspiration for the film, is being reissued to meet with Disney&#39;s large-budget advertising, promotion and publicity campaign.</p><p>Bambi comes into the world in a forest glade, loved by his mother, protected by a thicket. He grows up frolicking in the meadow, befriending butterflies and screech owls, and learning about the dark fear of all the woodland creatures: man. Over time, Bambi seeks out the wisdom of the prince of deer, a magnificent old stag who walks alone through the paths of the forest. Bambi is torn between his desire to be with his beloved mate, Faline, and his yearning for the knowledge and solitude the prince represents. He is also conflicted about his friend Gobo, who has returned to the forest after a winter living among humans. Gobo behaves unnaturally by strolling through the woods by day when other deer are sleeping, showing no fear of his natural mortal enemy.<p> This 1926 classic has been stretched and squeezed into many forms over the years, but the Felix Salten original should not be missed. With the richer, more highly wrought language of his time, Salten crafts a story layered in meaning, weighty with its message. The sometimes cruel, often joyful cycle of life continues, in spite of those who try to defy nature's law. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><b>The Prince of the Forest</b> <p> Bambi's life in the woods begins happily. There are forest animals to play with -- Friend Hare, the chattery squirrel, the noisy screech owl, and Bambi's twin cousins, frail Gobo and beautiful Faline. </p><p> But winter comes, and Bambi learns that the woods hold danger -- and things he doesn't understand. The first snowfall makes food hard to find. Bambi's father, a handsome stag, roams the forest, but leaves Bambi and his mother alone. </p><p> Then there is Man. He comes to the forest with weapons that can wound an animal. He does terrible things to Gobo, to Bambi's mother, and even to Bambi. But He can't keep Bambi from growing into a handsome stag himself, and becoming...the Prince of the Forest.</p></p><h2>Seinfeld: The Making of an American Icon</h2><p><p>The never-before-told story of how Jerry Seinfeld made his dream come true -- of how this very ambitious, extremely driven, compulsively perfectionistic carefully worked his way up through the knock-down-drag-out world of stand-up comedy as it began to explode in the mid-1970s, &amp; how he went on to co-create in the late 80s what is considered to be the most successful TV sitcom in its history. From the start, Jerry has been extremely private about all aspects of his personal life.

Oppenheimer spares nothing and no one in this saucy expos , covering Seinfeld's modest beginnings in Massapequa, Long Island (Seinfeld famously quipped that the town's name is Indian for "near the mall"), his days at SUNY Oswego and then Queens College, his introduction to the booming 1980s comedy club scene and his eventual launch of the most successful sitcom of the '90s. Oppenheimer digs up sources ranging from Seinfeld's neighbors and old classmates to rabbis, fellow comedians and, of course, ex-girlfriends. In fact, much of the book focuses on Seinfeld's apparent fear of commitment and his tendency to date the same type of woman (Jewish and noticeably younger than he). The author holds nothing back in giving the blow-by-blow of Seinfeld's romances with a teenage Shoshanna Lonstein and, later, freshly divorced (after a three-month marriage) Jessica Sklar. Regarding Seinfeld's career, Oppenheimer attributes the comic's success less to acting skills than simply a desire to be funny. Seinfeld's first shot at stand-up (at a Manhattan club's open mike night) was a disaster, but always the perfectionist he persevered and eventually hit it big. Oppenheimer who has indeed become a master of his own domain delivers a rollicking, sensational account of this "one-time poor boy from blue-collar Long Island who [became] very wealthy from being very funny."

Its buildings are made from mud, sticks, or plastic, its entire economy is grey, and its citizens survive on rations and luck. Over the course of four years, Ben Rawlence became a first-hand witness to a strange and desperate limbo-land, getting to know many of those who have come there seeking sanctuary. Among them are Guled, a former child soldier who lives for football; Nisho, who scrapes an existence by pushing a wheelbarrow and dreaming of riches; and schoolgirl Kheyro, whose future hangs upon her education. In City of Thorns, Rawlence interweaves the stories of nine individuals to show what life is like in the camp and to sketch the wider political forces that keep the refugees trapped there. Rawlence combines intimate storytelling with broad socio-political investigative journalism, doing for Dadaab what Katherine Boo&#39;s Behind the Beautiful Forevers did for the Mumbai slums. Lucid, vivid, and illuminating, City of Thorns is an urgent human story with deep international repercussions, brought to life through the people who call Dadaab home.</p><p>Ben Rawlence is a former researcher for Human Rights Watch in the horn of Africa.

At the same time he tried to find out what lies behind each nation&#39;s distinctive style of play from the carefree self-expression of the Brazilians to the anxious calculation of the Italians. During his journeys he met an extraordinary range of players, politicians and - of course - the fans themselves, all of whom revealed in their different ways the unique place football has in the life of the planet.</p><p>Simon Kuper is the author of Football Against the Enemy and writes for the Observer and the Financial Times.A terrific book * Guardian * Another great work on soccer ... effervescent and hilarious * Independent * Quality soccer books have mushroomed ... but none matches this global examination for originality, breadth and sheer courage * Mail on Sunday * This is a wonderful book written under great duress at times and full of the spirit of youthful exuberance and curiosity that runs way beyond the touchline * Time Out * If you like football, read it.

Though the author gives us several interesting characters-journalist Daniel Colter, dolphin researcher Sheila Roberts, tuna-boat captain Antonio Batera-and sketches convincing, often painful pasts for each, such subtleties are blurred by his soft-lensed focus on dolphin characters (with unwieldy names such as Ch*Tril and Ek*Tiq) and their cetacean point of view. The main plot develops in the dolphin sections, which explain that humans and dolphins were once in regular telepathic contact before our violent ways drove away the dolphins, who declared humanity off limits. Now, though, as human depredations in the sea are reaching critical levels, the dolphins have concluded that renewed contact may be the only way to end the slaughter. Colter, Roberts and Batera all felt the telepathic call of the dolphins when they were young, so they're the obvious choices for contact now. The narrative's early stages contain some drama, but it grows increasingly clogged with Grimwood's utopian vision of a dolphin-inspired paradise in which humanity's troubles are washed away by contact with the universally wise and kind cetaceans. The coda describing the eradication of most of the world's ills (AIDS, sexual repression, neurosis, "an effective end to war, to cruelty, to hunger") merely confirms this book's devolvement a muddle-headed, moralistic wish-fulfillment fantasy that substitutes airy preaching for real human feeling. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Story of &#34;Mormonism&#34; and the Philosophy of &#34;Mormonism&#34;</h2><p>The Story of &#34;Mormonism&#34; as presented in the following pages is a revised and reconstructed version of lectures delivered by Dr. James E. Talmage at the University of Michigan, Cornell University, and elsewhere. Mormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity. Joseph Smith founded the movement in Western New York in the 1820s. During the 1830s and 1840s, it distinguished itself from traditional Protestantism. Mormonism represents the faith taught by Smith in the 1840s. After he was killed in 1844, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the area that became the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Other sects include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy, and various other small independent denominations. The second-largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, since 2001 called the Community of Christ, does not describe itself as &#34;Mormon&#34;, but instead follows a Trinitarian Christian restorationist theology, and also considers itself Restorationist in terms of Latter Day Saint doctrine. The word Mormon originally derived from the Book of Mormon, a religious text published by Smith, which he said he translated from golden plates with divine assistance. The book describes itself as a chronicle of early indigenous peoples of the Americas and their dealings with God. Based on the name of that book, early followers of Smith were more widely known as Mormons, and their faith was called Mormonism. The term was initially considered pejorative, but Mormons no longer consider it so (although generally preferring other terms such as Latter-day Saint, or LDS). Mormonism shares a common set of beliefs with the rest of the Latter Day Saint movement, including use of and belief in the Bible, as well as in other religious texts including the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants. It also accepts the Pearl of Great Price as part of its scriptural canon, and has a history of teaching eternal marriage, eternal progression, and polygamy (plural marriage) (although the LDS Church formally abandoned the practice of plural marriage in 1890). Cultural Mormonism, a lifestyle promoted by Mormon institutions, includes cultural Mormons who identify with the culture, but not necessarily with the theology. Mormonism originated in the 1820s in western New York during a period of religious excitement known as the Second Great Awakening.[4] After praying about which denomination he should join, Joseph Smith, Jr. said he received a vision in the spring of 1820. Called the &#34;First Vision&#34;, Smith claimed God the Father instructed him to join none of the existing churches because they were all wrong. During the 1820s Smith reported several angelic visitations, and was eventually told that God would use him to re-establish the true Christian church, and that the Book of Mormon would be the means of establishing correct doctrine for the restored church. Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and other early followers, began baptizing new converts in 1829. Formally organized in 1830 as the Church of Christ. Smith was seen by his followers as a modern-day prophet. Joseph Smith claimed The Book of Mormon was translated from writing on golden plates in a reformed Egyptian language, translated with the assistance of the Urim and Thummim and seer stones. Both the special spectacles and the seer stone were at times referred to as the &#34;Urim and Thummim&#34;.[9][10] He said an angel first showed him the location of the plates in 1823, buried in a nearby hill, but he was not allowed to take the plates until 1827. Smith began dictating the text of The Book of Mormon around the fall of 1827 until the summer of 1828 when 116 pages were lost. Translation began again in April 1829 and finished in June 1829.</p><p></p><h2>Barber of Seville</h2><p>The Black Dog Opera Library is the most popular, informative, and budget-friendly way to enjoy all the great operas.

He shows his respect for the traditions of his people to honor nature and family in his own reminiscences and in his retellings of two traditional tales. He is also quite outspoken about his strong opposition to the Japanese government overrunning the land of Ainu Mosir. Unfortunately, the text is choppy and not well organized, and some of the material is not appropriate for children (for example, he describes how, when he was a boy, his mother would warm his cold hands between her breasts). This, combined with very small and crowded print, and somewhat dated-looking, earth-toned watercolors, makes the title uninviting.

Dunn argues that humans today depend more abjectly and extensively than ever before on the capacity of some of our number for skillful political action. There are many reasons for this dependence: closely linked nuclear-threat and financial systems, massive trade flows that sustain or imperil the well-being of all modern populations, and the awesome scale of the unintended ecological effects of human production. Why has modern political theory failed to relate these factors systematically to one another and to provide people with adequate reasons for action? To answer this twin query, Dunn brilliantly deploys the resources of the historical development of Western political thinking, in counterpoint with some of the main lessons of international political economy.</p><p>The concluding essay reasserts that the classical virtue of prudence has a central place in contemporary politics. The conditions of modern politics, it maintains, require the exercise of prudence not merely by political, military, and economic leaders, but also by the populace at large. Overall, this selection of Dunn's most influential work of the past decade reflects his remarkable range of interestsincluding Locke's ideological importance, the nature of trust in politics, rights, liberty, responsibility at a national level, postcolonial African politics, and political community. The book will be required reading for students from a variety of disciplines.</p><p>Originally published in 1990.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

She writes about Sondheim's early ambition to become a concert pianist, about the effect on him of his parents' divorce when he was ten, about his years in military and private schools. She writes about his feelings of loneliness and abandonment, about the refuge he found in the home of Oscar and Dorothy Hammerstein, and his determination to become just like Oscar.<br>Secrest describes the years when Sondheim was struggling to gain a foothold in the theatre, his attempts at scriptwriting (in his early twenties in Rome on the <br>set of Beat the Devil with Bogart and Huston, and later in Hollywood as a co-writer with George Oppenheimer for the TV series Topper), living the Hollywood life.<br>Here is Sondheim's ascent to the peaks of the Broadway musical, from his chance meeting with play-<br>wright Arthur Laurents, which led to his first success--<br>as co-lyricist with Leonard Bernstein on West Side Story--to his collaboration with Laurents on Gypsy, to his first full Broadway score, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. And Secrest writes about his first big success as composer, lyricist, writer in the 1960s with Company, an innovative and sophisticated musical that examined marriage � la mode. It was the start of an almost-twenty-year collaboration with producer and director Hal Prince that resulted in such shows as Follies, Pacific Overtures, Sweeney Todd, and <br>A Little Night Music.<br>We see Sondheim at work with composers, producers, directors, co-writers, actors, the greats of his time and ours, among them Leonard Bernstein, Ethel Merman, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, Jerome Robbins, Zero Mostel, Bernadette Peters, and Lee Remick (with whom it was said he was in love, and she with him), as Secrest vividly re-creates the energy, the passion, the despair, the excitement, the genius, that went into the making of show after Sondheim show.<br>A biography that is sure to become the standard work on Sondheim's life and art.</p><p>America's foremost musical-theater composer also proves to be a fascinatingly complex and conflicted human being in this meticulous biography by the always-capable Meryle Secrest (<i>Being Bernard Berenson</i>, etc.). Stephen Sondheim himself was interviewed for the book, as were many of his closest friends, and the author makes perceptive use of this material. Born in 1930, Sondheim was a successful Broadway lyricist (<i>West Side Story</i> and <i>Gypsy</i>) before he was 30. But the scars from a miserable childhood remained: he was inclined to be distant, hypercritical of those less intelligent than he, and terrified of serious emotional commitment. Critics sometimes found those qualities in the series of groundbreaking musicals he created with director Hal Prince--<i>Company</i>, <i>Follies</i>, <i>A Little Night Music</i>, and <i>Sweeney Todd</i>, to name four--but they agreed that he brought new intellectual ambition and artistic adventurousness to the musical theater. Secrest does a fine job of delineating Sondheim's career in terms of what it tells us about the state of American theater, as when he shifted to a partnership with writer-director James Lapine and worked in the nonprofit sector for such musicals as <i>Sunday in the Park with George</i> and <i>Assassins</i>. She also does well in selecting revealing quotes to depict the composer's struggle to accept his homosexuality and a rage at his overbearing mother so deep that he didn't even attend her funeral. Sondheim the man and Sondheim the visionary artist get nearly equal time in an intriguing portrait.Meryle Secrest was born and educated in Bath, England. She has written biographies of Romaine Brooks, Bernard Berenson, Kenneth Clark, Salvador Dal�, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Leonard Bernstein.</p><h2>The End of the Peace Process: Oslo and After</h2><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the Oslo accords were signed in September 1993 by Israel and Palestinian Liberation Organization, Edward Said predicted that they could not lead to real peace.&nbsp; In these essays, most written for Arab and European newspapers, Said uncovers the political mechanism that advertises reconciliation in the Middle East while keeping peace out of the picture.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said argues that the imbalance in power that forces Palestinians and Arab states to accept the concessions of the United States and Israel prohibits real negotiations and promotes the second-class treatment of Palestinians.&nbsp; He documents what has really gone on in the occupied territories since the signing.&nbsp; He reports worsening conditions for the Palestinians critiques Yasir Arafat's self-interested and oppressive leadership, denounces Israel's refusal to recognize Palestine's past, and&#x2014;in essays new to this edition&#x2014;addresses the resulting unrest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this unflinching cry for civic justice and self-determination, Said promotes not a political agenda but a transcendent alternative: the peaceful coexistence of Arabs and Jews enjoying equal rights and shared citizenship.</p></p><p>"Said (author of the highly praised memoir <b>Out of Place</b>) once again brings acute insight to a controversial subject.... Deeply concerned with the fate of the Palestinian people, and without mincing words, Said probes their relationship to the Israeli government and their lives under Arafat's Palestinian Authority... A potent analysis--one that refuses to follow a party line--of the complexities and stark realities of Middle Eastern politics. "<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i>Edward Said demonstrates why he is considered the preeminent observer and critic of the Middle East peace process in this collection of fifty essays, written mostly for Arab and European newspapers in the last five years and previously not readily available to American readers. <br>Said uncovers the political mechanism that advertises reconciliation in the Middle East while keeping peace out of the picture. He cites the imbalance of power that forces Palestinians and Arab states to accept the concessions of the United States and Israel, thus prohibiting real negotiations and promoting the second-class treatment of Palestinians. He critiques Arafat's self-interested leadership and the oppressive Palestinian Authority, criticizes the general quiescence of Palestinian life, and denounces Israel's refusal to recognize Palestine's past. In this unflinching cry for civic justice and self-determination, Said promotes not a political agenda but a transcendent alternative: the peaceful coexistence of Arabs and Jews enjoying equal rights and shared citizenship.</p><h2>Neveryona or: The Tale of Signs and Cities</h2><p>Pryn, a young country girl who flees her village on the back of a dragon, searches for Neveryona, a fabulous lost civilization, encountering a host of intriguing characters along the way</p><p>5 3/8 x 8 1/2 trim.

In an absorbing and lively new book on The Bay, James Raffan explores the forces that moulded a man, a company and a country.</p><p>The histories of Sir George Simpson and the HBC in the golden years of the 19th century are in many ways one history, for Simpson&#x2019;s professional acumen and personal ambitions propelled a failing business to a position of great wealth and political power. At its height, the HBC trading territory covered an astonishing one-twelfth of the world&#x2019;s surface. Raffan captures the many contradictions of the larger-than-life man at its centre: a brilliant manager who kept an iron grip on his fur forts from east to west, ensuring British power across the land; a pompous dandy who was most at home in a voyageur-paddled canoe; a man ashamed of his illegitimate birth but who went on to sire 13 children with eight different women, only one of whom was his wife; a master businessman who laid the foundations for the single greatest business enterprise of its day. <em>Emperor of the North</em> is the vibrant tale of a man who shaped much more than a fur-trading company&#x2015;he launched an empire of ideas that led to the creation of a country. Meticulously researched, highly readable and wonderfully illuminated by maps and archival photographs, <em>Emperor of the North</em> is a delight for history buffs, armchair adventurers and biography fans alike.</p></p><p><p>James Raffan is one of our foremost authorities on the North, the wilderness and the canoeing tradition.

In order to understand violence as a fundamentally heterogeneous phenomenon, it is essential to go beyond interpersonal partner violence and analyze the workings of institutional and structural violence. Self-help books, some shelters, the courts, federal and state legislation, empirical studies, therapeutic models, and even some mainstream feminist polemics presume that all women face the same kind of violence. This assumption masks violence that does not conform to the imagined norm, such as violence against women who are sex workers, lesbians, homeless, and/or undocumented. Joshua M. Price&#x2019;s exploration of these issues is based on several years of research involving participant-observation in domestic violence courts and extensive interviews with activists, advocates, incarcerated women, and women who have faced various forms of violence. Both conceptually and methodologically, the book challenges narrow notions of violence against women and demonstrates implications for judicial intervention and other forms of public involvement.</p><p><p>Joshua M. Price is Associate Professor and Director, Program in Philosophy, Interpretation, and Culture at Binghamton University, State University of New York. He is the cotranslator (with Mar�a Lugones) of Rodolfo Kusch&#x2019;s Indigenous and Popular Thinking in Am�rica.</p>&#x201c;This is an important book that provides a novel perspective on issues of women and violence. Price importantly points out that although structural violence produces enormous inequality and disadvantage, it often remains invisible from the standpoint of the dominant culture.&#x201d; &#x2015; Kristin Bumiller, author of In an Abusive State: How Neoliberalism Appropriated the Feminist Movement against Sexual Violence</p><h2>DK Eyewitness The Netherlands (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p>Your in-depth guide to the very best of the Netherlands.

For one year, they would only consume food that came from within a 100-mile radius of their Vancouver apartment. The 100-Mile Diet was born.<br><br>The couple&#x2019;s discoveries sometimes shook their resolve. It would be a year without sugar, Cheerios, olive oil, rice, Pizza Pops, beer, and much, much more. Yet local eating has turned out to be a life lesson in pleasures that are always close at hand. They met the revolutionary farmers and modern-day hunter-gatherers who are changing the way we think about food. They got personal with issues ranging from global economics to biodiversity. They called on the wisdom of grandmothers, and immersed themselves in the seasons. They discovered a host of new flavours, from gooseberry wine to sunchokes to turnip sandwiches, foods that they never would have guessed were on their doorstep.<br><br>The 100-Mile Diet struck a deeper chord than anyone could have predicted, attracting media and grassroots interest that spanned the globe. The <b>100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating</b> tells the full story, from the insights to the kitchen disasters, as the authors transform from megamart shoppers to self-sufficient urban pioneers. The 100-Mile Diet is a pathway home for anybody, anywhere.<br><br><i>Call me naive, but I never knew that flour would be struck from our 100-Mile Diet. Wheat products are just so ubiquitous, &#x201c;the staff of life,&#x201d; that I had hazily imagined the stuff must be grown everywhere. But of course: I had never seen a field of wheat anywhere close to Vancouver, and my mental images of late-afternoon light falling on golden fields of grain were all from my childhood on the Canadian prairies. What I was able to find was Anita&#x2019;s Organic Grain &amp; Flour Mill, about 60 miles up the Fraser River valley. I called, and learned that Anita&#x2019;s nearest grain suppliers were at least 800 miles away by road. She sounded sorry for me.

What we had on hand, really, was a head of cabbage. Deep inside its brainwork of folds it was probably nourishing enough, but the outer layers were greasy with rot, as though the vegetable were trying to be a metaphor for something. We had company to feed, and a three-week-old cabbage to offer them.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t as though we could step out to the local megamart. We &#x2013; Alisa and I &#x2013; were at our &#x201c;cottage&#x201d; in northern British Columbia, more honestly a drafty, jauntily leaning, eighty-year-old homestead that squats in a clearing between Sitka spruce and western redcedar trees large enough to crush it into splinters with the sweep of a limb. The front door looks out on a jumble of mountains named after long-forgotten British lords, from the peaks of which you can see, just to the northwest, the southern tip of the Alaska Panhandle. There is no corner store here. In fact, there is no electricity, no flush toilet, and no running water but for the Skeena River rapids known as the Devil&#x2019;s Elbow. They&#x2019;re just outside the back door. Our nearest neighbour is a black bear. There are also no roads. In fact, the only ways in or out are by canoe, by foot over the distance of a half-marathon to the nearest highway, or by the passenger train that passes once or twice a day, and not at all on Tuesdays. So: We had a cabbage, and a half-dozen mouths to feed for one more autumn evening. Necessity, as they say, can be a mother.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t remember now who said what, or how we made the plan, or even if we planned it at all. What I know is that my brother David, a strict vegetarian, hiked to the mouth of Fiddler Creek, which straight-lines out of a bowl of mountains so ancient they make you feel perpetually reborn, and reeled in an enormous Dolly Varden char. Our friends Kirk and Chandra, who are the sort of people who can tell a Bewick&#x2019;s wren from a rufous-crowned sparrow by ear, led a party into the forest and returned with pound upon pound of chanterelle, pine, and hedgehog mushrooms. I rooted through the tall grass to find the neglected garden plot where, months earlier, we had planted garlic and three kinds of potato; each turned up under the spade, as cool and autonomous as teenagers. Alisa cut baby dandelion leaves, while her mother picked apples and sour cherries from an abandoned orchard, and rosehips from the bushes that were attempting to swallow the outhouse. The fruit we steeped in red wine &#x2013; all right, the wine came from Australia. Everything else we fried on the woodstove, all in a single huge pan.<br><br>It was delicious. It was a dinner that transcended the delicate freshness of the fish, the earthy goodness of the spuds that had sopped up the juices of mushrooms and garlic. The rich flavours were the evening&#x2019;s shallowest pleasure. We knew, now, that out there in the falling darkness the river and the forest spoke a subtle language we had only begun to learn. It was the kind of meal that, when the plates were clean, led some to dark corners to sleep with the hushing of the wind, and others to drink mulled wine until our voices had climbed an octave and finally deepened, in the small hours, into whispers. One of the night&#x2019;s final questions, passed around upon faces made golden by candlelight: Was there some way to carry this meal into the rest of our lives?<br><br>A week later we were back in our one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver, surrounded by two million other people and staring out the sitting-room window. We have a view of a parking lot and two perpetually overloaded Dumpsters. It was as good a place as any to contemplate the statistic. The number just kept turning up: in the reports that Alisa and I read as journalists; in the inch-long news briefs I&#x2019;ve come to rely on as an early-warning system for stories that would, in a few months or a few years, work their way into global headlines. According to the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, the food we eat now typically travels between 1,500 and 3,000 miles from farm to plate. The distance had increased by up to 25 percent between 1980 and 2001, when the study was published. It was likely continuing to climb.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know any more about it than that. It was enough. Like so many other people, Alisa and I had begun to search for ways to live more lightly in an increasingly crowded and raggedy-assed world. There is no shortage of information about this bright blue planet and its merry trip to hell in a hand-basket, and we had learned the necessary habit of shrugging off the latest news bites about &#x201c;dead zones&#x201d; in the Gulf of Mexico or creatures going extinct after 70 million years&#x2013;70 million years&#x2013;on Earth. What we could not ignore was the gut feeling, more common and more important than policy-makers or even scientists like to admit, that <i>things have gone sideways</i>. That the winter snow is less deep than it was when we were children, the crabs fewer under the rocks by the shore, the birds at dawn too quiet, the forest oddly lonesome. That the weather and seasons have become strangers to us. And that we, the human species, are in one way or another responsible. Not <i>guilty</i>, but responsible.<br><br>The gut feeling affects people. I received a letter once, as a journalist, from a young man who had chained himself to a railing in a mall on the biggest shopping day of the year in America, the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and set himself on fire to protest rampant consumerism. He survived, barely, and was ordered into mental health care, but all of his opinions were of a kind commonly held by some of the most lucid and admired ecologists and social theorists of our times. A friend of mine, a relationship counsellor, told me of a couple whose marriage was being tested by a disagreement over the point at which the world&#x2019;s reserves of cheap petroleum will surpass maximum production and begin to decline. Concerned for his child&#x2019;s future in an &#x201c;end of oil&#x201d; scenario, the husband, an otherwise typical health-care provider, wanted to go bush, learn how to tan buckskins, teach their boy to hunt and forage. The wife, equally concerned for the child, preferred everyday life in a society where carbonated soda is the leading source of calories in the diet of the average teenager and the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> reports that, owing to obesity and physical inactivity, the life spans of today&#x2019;s children may be shorter than those of their parents.

Crowds bustled. Shelves cleared. The window of the Curio Shop on East Prairie Avenue was heaped high with broken dishes, torn fans, ripped up paper lanterns. They'd wrecked all their Made-in-Japan merchandise and made a display of it that drew a crowd. </p><p>Scooter and I looked, but it was something in the window of Black's Hardware that pulled us back every Saturday, to see if it was still there. </p><p>A Schwinn bicycle stood in the window. A solitary Schwinn, casual on its kickstand, sharp as a knife. Two-toned cream and crimson with a headlight like a tiny torpedo. An artificial squirrel tail dyed red, white, and blue hung off the back fender under the reflector. I couldn't look at the thing without tearing up. You could have played those chrome spokes like a harp. And look at the tread on those tires. </p><p>It was the last Schwinn in town, and maybe the whole country, for the duration. The duration was the new wartime word, and you heard it all day long, like the song "Remember Pearl Harbor," on the radio, over and over. The duration meant for however long the war would last. </p><p>I'd been wanting a two-wheeler for a year and thought I could handle that Schwinn, though it was full-sized and weighed thirty pounds. I thought I was long enough in the leg and had the arms for it, almost. Never mind that I didn't know how to ride a bike. </p><p>I didn't expect to get it for Christmas, and didn't. It was twice what bikes cost, and the last one on earth. Scooter and I checked on that Schwinn faithfully, knowing that one Saturday it wouldn't be there. </p><p>I pictured the kid who'd get it, some rich kid from up on Moreland Heights. I saw him in new Boy Scout shoes and salt-and-pepper knickers and a chin-strap helmet with goggles, swooping down a curving road with that patriotic squirrel tail standing out behind. I saw the easy arcs he made from ditch to ditch. He'd be a little older than we were, a year or tow older. </p><p>We didn't know what to expect out of Christmas this year. Scooter usually did pretty well for presents. He already had his Chem-Craft chemistry set. We'd had our first fire with it, burning a circle out of the insulation on the Tomlinsons' basement ceiling. </p><p>The stink bomb we'd built to go under Old Lady Graves's back step had gone off too soon, in Scooter's arms. I threw up the minute I smelled him, and his mom made him strip naked in their yard. She hosed him down and burned his shirt in a leaf drum. But that was last summer after his birthday. </p><p>One December Saturday when we checked, Black's window was empty, and the Schwinn was gone. </p><p>Dad brought home a tree standing up out of the Packard's rumble seat. People said there'd be no trees next Christmas and no string of lights when these burned out. Mom baked all Bill's favorites. Dad rolled out peanut brittle on a marble dresser top. People said that next year there wouldn't be enough sugar for Christmas baking. </p><p>But this one still smelled like the real thing: pine needles and nutmeg, Vicks and something just coming out of the oven in a long pan. And Bill was home. "That's Christmas enough for me," Mom murmured. </p><p>We untangled the string of tree lights, Bill and I, stretching them through the house. He could stick the star on top without stretching. But then he and Dad had hung the moon. </p><p>Bill was home from St. Louis with a full-length topcoat and his aeronautics textbooks. Bill wanted to fly, and he was taxiing for takeoff already. </p><p>He and Dad were down in the basement on Christmas Eve, puttering on mysterious business while Mom kept me busy. When Bill came upstairs, wiping grease off his hands, the kitchen radio was playing "Stardust." Bill swept Mom away from the sink, and they danced, turning around, the kitchen like it was the Alhambra Ballroom and Mom was his date. Her forehead was shiny, and her eyes were shining. She still held a dish towel that hung down from his shoulder. They danced until the radio began to play "Remember Pearl Harbor," and Mom switched it off. </p><p>Bill slept in the big from room upstairs. Dad had divided the attic in two and boxed in the rooms under the eaves. I had the little one at the back. We didn't get a lot of heat up here. On nights this cold I wore mittens and a cap to bed. </p><p>You could talk between the rooms. The wall was beaverboard, and we left the door open. From his bed, Bill said, "Davy? You remember to hang up your stocking?" </p><p>No answer from me. I was too old to hang up a stocking, as we both knew. "What did you get me?" Bill inquired because it was a known fact that I couldn't keep a secret. </p><p>"A pen wiper," I said. "Pen wipers for everybody. We made them in school." </p><p>"Miss Mossman?" Bill said, naming my teacher. He'd had her. "A pen wiper's good," he said. "I'll keep it on my desk and take it with me. Wherever." </p><p>Silence then. Silent night. </p><p>"What did you get me?" I asked, and my breath puffed a cloud. I hoped for his high school letter sweater, Cardinal Red. He'd lettered in track. I'd go in his closet and try it on a lot. It hit me just above the ankle. </p><p>"You get anything for me?" I asked in the dark because he was drifting off. </p><p>"Socks," he mumbled, "underwear." </p><p>"Oh," I said. I turned over once, and it was morning. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The 10 Lenses: Your Guide to Living and Working in a Multicultural World (Capital Ideas for Business &amp; Personal Development)</h2><p>In this ground-breaking new book, acclaimed diversity expert Mark Williams offers ten &#34;eye-opening&#34; lenses to help you, your organization, and everyone in it, understand how cultural diversity affects the way we live and work.

Some of these quilts use traditional 19th-century patterns. Others offer distinctly modern takes on Amish ideas. They all celebrate the simplicity, the bold geometry, and the rich dark fabrics that give Amish quilts their ageless appeal. Includes 21 Amish-inspired quilts with complete instructions, plus photo gallery with 17 more quilts. Easy-to-make patterns show off today's beautiful solid fabrics.<br></p><p>Lynn Koolish works in a variety of styles and loves experimenting with new ideas, materials, and techniques. She edits quilting books full-time and teaches a variety of surface design and quilting classes. Her quilts have appeared in books, magazines, and local and national quilt shows. Lynn resides in Berkeley, CA.The use of solid fabrics and the focus on geometric designs make Amish and Amish-style quilts appealing to both traditional and modern quilters. Published in honor of C&amp;T Publishing&#x2019;s 30th anniversary, this compilation revisits the subject of An Amish Adventure, the company&#x2019;s first title. Though many of the quilts here are not made by the Amish and don&#x2019;t strictly follow the Amish way of design, the emphasis on solids and the intricate technique (often by machine, here, instead of by hand) are typical of Amish tradition. There&#x2019;s also plenty of information about color; because only solids are used, the colors, rather than the prints, provide the visual interest. VERDICT The Amish way of life is fascinating to many, and this exploration of Amish quilting traditions through contemporary fabrics will appeal to quilters of all styles. (<i>Library Journal, 9/18/13</i>)<br><br>This book is a sequel to An Amish Adventure which introduced quilters to Amish quilting. Some of the quilts here use traditional 19th century patterns, while others are modern takes on Amish ideas.

Fry started out as a dishonorable schoolboy inclined to lies, pranks, bringing decaying moles to school as a science exhibit, theft, suicide attempts, the illicit pursuit of candy and lads, a genius for mischief, and a neurotic life of crime that sent him straight to Pucklechurch Prison and Cambridge University, where he vaulted to fame along with actress Emma Thompson. He wound up starring as Oscar Wilde in the film <i>Wilde</i>, costarring in <i>A Civil Action</i>, and writing funny, distinguished novels. <p> This irresistible book, the best-written celebrity memoir of 1999, concentrates on Fry's first two tumultuous decades, but beware! A Fry sentence can lead anywhere, from a ringing defense of beating schoolchildren to a thoughtful comparison of male and female naughty parts. Fry's deepest regrets seem to be the elusiveness of a particular boy's love and the fact that, despite his keen ear for music, Fry's singing voice can make listeners "claw out their inner ears, electrocute their genitals, put on a Jim Reeves record, throw themselves cackling hysterically onto the path of moving buses... anything, anything to take away the pain." A chance mention of Fry's time-travel book about thwarting Hitler, <i>Making History</i> (a finalist for the 1998 Sidewise Award for Best Alternative History), leads to the startling real-life revelation that Fry's own Jewish uncle may have loaned a young, shivering Hitler the coat off his back. </p><p> Fry's life is full of school and jailhouse blues overcome by jaunty wit, � la <i>Wilde</i>. The title, from Psalm 108:9, refers to King David's triumph over the Philistines. Fry triumphs similarly, and with more style. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>A number one bestseller in Britain that topped the lists there for months, Stephen Fry's astonishingly frank, funny, wise memoir is the book that his fans everywhere have been waiting for. Since his PBS television debut in the Blackadder series, the American profile of this multitalented writer, actor and comedian has grown steadily, especially in the wake of his title role in the film Wilde, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination, and his supporting role in A Civil Action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Fry has already given readers a taste of his tumultuous adolescence in his autobiographical first novel, <i>The Liar</i>, and now he reveals the equally tumultuous life that inspired it. Sent to boarding school at the age of seven, he survived beatings, misery, love affairs, carnal violation, expulsion, attempted suicide, criminal conviction and imprisonment to emerge, at the age of eighteen, ready to start over in a world in which he had always felt a stranger. One of very few Cambridge University graduates to have been imprisoned prior to his freshman year, Fry is a brilliantly idiosyncratic character who continues to attract controversy, empathy and real devotion. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>This extraordinary and affecting book has "a tragic grandeur that lifts it to classic status," raved the <i>Financial Times</i> in one of the many ecstatic British reviews. Stephen Fry's autobiography, in turns funny, shocking, sad, bruisingly frank and always compulsively readable, could well become a classic gay coming-of-age memoir.</p><h2>Bohannon&#39;s Country: Mystery Stories</h2><p>Ex-sheriff Hack Bohannon and his crew--including grizzled rodeo rider George Stubbs and student priest Manuel Rivera--discover that death can be as unpredictable as the California landscape. 17,500 first printing. $15,000 ad/promo.</p><p>In five new short stories, Hansen is in top form, delighting readers with surprising, often risk-taking, fiction.

Bruccoli and Park Bucker have for the first time collected the short stories Heller published prior to that first novel, along with all the other short pieces of fiction and nonfiction that were published during his lifetime. Also included are five previously unpublished short stories, most reflecting the influence on Heller of urban naturalist writers such as Irwin Shaw and Nelson Algren.<br> <br>The result is an important and significant addition to our understanding and appreciation of Joseph Heller, showing his evolution as a writer and artist. For those unfamiliar with his work, it will serve as an excellent introduction; for everyone else, <i>Catch As Catch Can</i> is a chance to explore a new aspect of Heller's remarkable career.</p><p>With his first book, the seminal anti-war novel <i>Catch-22</i>, Joseph Heller became one of American literature's most important 20th-century writers. The posthumous collection, <i>Catch As Catch Can: The Collected Stories and Other Writings</i>, shows Heller's early development as a writer, but in essence provides the "outtakes," "B-sides," and sketches related to <i>Catch-22</i>, and several nonfiction pieces regarding it, mixed with juvenilia. A more appropriate title might have been <i>The Making of Catch-22</i>. <p> Heller's early forays into fiction are somewhat memorable, such as "The Girl from Greenwich," a story about vanity, and "A Man Named Flute," wherein a father deals with the discovery of his son's drug use. Also, "World Full of Great Cities" is a disturbing look at what a couple might do to save their marriage. This collection, however, contains a great many works that revolve around <i>Catch-22</i>, or contain characters that appear in that work, including two chapters cut from the novel and published as independent stories: "Love, Dad" and "Yossarian Survives." Not surprisingly, these are the strongest works in the book. "Love, Dad" provides the first introduction to Edward J. Nately III, who "was often lonely and nagged by vague, incipient longings. He contemplated his sophomore year at Harvard without enthusiasm, without joy. Fortunately, the War broke out in time to save him." Joseph Heller will be known forever for his great novel, <i>Catch-22</i>, and <i>Catch As Catch Can</i> serves to back up this notion. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p>Joseph Heller was born in Brooklyn in 1923. In 1961, he published <i>Catch-22</i>, which became a bestseller and, in 1970, a film. He went on to write such novels as <i>Good as Gold, God Knows, Picture This, Closing Time</i>, and <i>Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man</i>. Heller died in 1999.</p><h2>Iroquoia: The Development of a Native World (The Iroquois and Their Neighbors)</h2><p>Drawing on archaeology, historical evidence, oral traditions, and linguistics, this book provides a view of Iroquois life from the prehistoric period and Owasco sites through the establishment of the Five Nations.</p><p>William Engelbrecht is professor emeritus of anthropology at Buffalo State College. His articles have appeared in many journals, including American Antiquity, North American Archaeologist, Northeast Anthropology, and Bulletin: Journal of the New York State Archaeological Association.This volume represents far more than a description of the culture, history, and archaeological record of the Iroquoisit is an accessible, anthropological account of their world.

And you'll never hear them coming.<br><br>The Slicky Boys steal, they kill, they slip away. And George and Ernie are about to discover that even the U.S. military is no match for evil, and that human sympathy can sometimes lead to a lonely grave.</p><p>This thriller by a retired army officer has many things going for it: two very well-drawn central characters who are U.S. military police based in Seoul; a large cast of colorful secondary characters; some lively and inventive plot twists; and a setting--South Korea in 1975, 20 years after the Korean War--quickly brought to vivid life. George Sueno, the brains of the two-man Army CID team, grew up in foster homes in East Los Angeles, learned Korean quickly, and isn&#39;t nearly as baffled by the complexity of Korean customs as most of his fellow soldiers. His partner, Ernie Bascom, found a home in the Army better than the one he&#39;d left in Detroit to go to Vietnam; he&#39;s a blaze of mad action and sexual energy. They make an excellent team, bringing back memories of Chester Himes&#39;s Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson--two cops who also bent the rules to get results."Cliff-hanging action...thrilling...unexpected."<br><i>--The Wall Street Journal</i><p>"There's atmosphere to spare here, and enough suspense to please.

They lack creative clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Creative clarity requires you to do four things:&nbsp;1. Choreograph a creative strategy, describing a clear future even among the blurry business landscape.<br>2. Grow teams that include those creative, unpredictable outcasts; &nbsp;give them the space to produce amazing work; and build a unique form of trust in your company culture.<br>3. Institutionalize an iterative process of critique, conflict, and ideation.<br>4. Embrace chaos but manage creative spin and stagnation.&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is primarily for people in charge of driving strategic change through an organization. If you are a line manager responsible for exploring a horizon of opportunity, the book will help you establish a culture of creative product development in which your teams can predictably deliver creative results. You'll learn methods to drive trust among your team members to enable you to critique and improve their work. And as an organizational leader, you'll complement your traditional business strategies with the new language and understanding you need to implement creativity in a strategic manner across your company.&nbsp;In a creative environment, chaos is the backdrop for hidden wonderment and success. In this book, you'll gain clarity in the face of that chaos, so you can build great products, great teams, and a high-performing creative organization. &nbsp;</p><p>Jon is Partner at Modernist Studio, and the Founder of Austin Center for Design.&nbsp;He was previously the Vice President of Design at Blackboard, the largest educational software company in the world.

It defines our experience of the world; it echoes through our every waking hour. Time is the very foundation of conscious experience. Yet as familiar as it is, time is also deeply mysterious. We cannot see, hear, smell, taste, or touch it. Yet we do <i>feel</i> it&#x2015;or at least we <i>think</i> we feel it. No wonder poets, writers, philosophers, and scientists have grappled with time for centuries.</p><p>In his latest book, award-winning science writer Dan Falk chronicles the story of how humans have come to understand time over the millennia, and by drawing from the latest research in physics, psychology, and other fields, Falk shows how that understanding continues to evolve. <i>In Search of Time</i> begins with our earliest ancestors' perception of time and the discoveries that led&#x2015;with much effort&#x2015;to the Gregorian calendar, atomic clocks, and "leap seconds." Falk examines the workings of memory, the brain's remarkable "bridge across time," and asks whether humans are unique in their ability to recall the past and imagine the future. He explores the possibility of time travel, and the paradoxes it seems to entail. Falk looks at the quest to comprehend the beginning of time and how time&#x2015;and the universe&#x2015;may end. Finally, he examines the puzzle of time's "flow," and the remarkable possibility that the passage of time may be an illusion.</p><p>Entertaining, illuminating, and ultimately thought provoking, <i>In Search of Time </i>reveals what some of our most insightful thinkers have had to say about time, from Aristotle to Kant, from Newton to Einstein, and continuing with the brightest minds of today.</p></p><p><p>Dan Falk has written about science for <i>The Boston Globe,</i> <i>The Globe and Mail,</i> <i>The</i> <i>Walrus,</i> <i>Astronomy,</i> <i>Nature,</i> and <i>New Scientist,</i> and has been a regular contributor to the CBC Radio programs <i>Ideas</i> and <i>Quirks and Quarks</i>.

In keeping with his conviction that studying multiple religious traditions intensifies rather than attenuates religious devotion, Francis Clooney's latest work of comparative theology seeks a way beyond today's religious and interreligious uncertainty by pairing a fresh reading of the absence of the beloved in the Biblical Song of Songs with a pioneering study of the same theme in the Holy Word of Mouth (9th century CE), a classic of Hindu mystical poetry rarely studied in the West. Remarkably, the pairing of these texts is grounded not in a general theory of religion, but in an engagement with two unexpected sources: the theopoetics, theodramatics, and theology of the 20th-century Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, and the intensely perceived and written poetry of Pulitzer Prize winner Jorie Graham. How we read and write on religious matters is transformed by this rare combination of voices in what is surely a unique and important contribution to comparative studies and religious hermeneutics.</p><p>Francis X. Clooney, S.J. is Parkman Professor of Divinity and Professor of Comparative Theology at the Harvard Divinity School, where he also directs the Center for the Study of World Religions. A Roman Catholic priest and a member of the Society of Jesus, he is the author of numerous books, including <i>Beyond Compare: St. Francis de Sales and Sri Vedanta Desika on Loving Surrender to God</i> (2008) and <i>Comparative Theology: Deep Learning across Religious Borders</i> (2010). In 2010, Clooney was elected a Fellow of the British Academy."An unquenchable longing and passion of the lover in God's absence is observed, even intensely felt by the reader, when Clooney juxtaposes passages of the <i>Song of Solomon</i> with parallel passages of the Tiruvaymoli, or the <i>Holy Word</i>. The effect of this is as powerful as it is poignant: the reader not only observes lovers within these two traditions desperately seeking their divine beloved, but the reader is drawn ever more into this new community of divine mystery and secretiveness that Clooney so eloquently creates in his work. The reader is drawn into the theopoetics and theodrama that brings out a desperate and intense longing that lovers of God from both traditions share. Clooney's work contributes to a religious 'pluralism' that reveals something of a newer theological moment, a spark of revelational power that enters into fresh understandings of the intimate depths of divinity." (Graham M. Schweig <i>Christopher Newport University</i>)<br><br>"Francis Clooney, S.J.'s <i>His Hiding Place is Darkness</i> takes us into an entirely different world of experience and expression of divine absence in a biblical and in a Hindu sacred text . . . [I]t is beautifully written in a style flowing with the texts he reads." (Catherine Cornille <i><i>America Magazine: The National Catholic Review</i></i>)<br><br>"In his latest book <i>His Hiding Place Is Darkness: A Hindu-Catholic Theopoetics of Divine Absence</i>, Francis X. Clooney takes his comparative work in exciting new directions. The book marks a continuation of Clooney's significant contributions toward developing comparative theology as a robust and active subfield in religious studies, and Clooney's extended exposition on the theme of 'divine absence' across two texts from the Christian and Hindu traditions is his most intensely personal and remarkably poetic work to date. Reading closely across these historically disparate yet thematically intertwined texts, <i>His Hiding Place Is Darkness</i> offers a remarkably lucid analysis that both showcases the interpretive acumen of an accomplished comparative theologian and opens up new possibilities for the field of comparative theology . . . Ultimately, Clooney offers a compelling comparative reading of the Song of Songs and the Tiruvaymoli based on his own finely-honed interpretive abilities as well as insights from the commentarial tradition of each text. The result of this effort is a beautifully-written manuscript that blends the grinding work of translation and textual analysis with the imaginative possibilities opened up through poetry . . . This book marks an important point in Clooney's own 'continuous forward striving' as an accomplished scholar and writer, and it is one that should be taken seriously by scholars in a variety of subfields across religious studies and especially by scholars in comparative theology." (Jason W. Smith <i><i>Journal of Comparative Theology</i></i>)<br><br>"Clooney's work therefore offers a challenge to Christian theologians to overcome their sometimes parochial engagements with biblical horizons and to seek out the Spirit, which blows where it wills, through gardens other than Gethsemane and on hills other than Golgotha. As we follow the travails of the two women, we become aware of a few common themes that emerge from his detailed textual readings . . . One of the great merits of <i>His Hiding Place Is Darkness</i> is that it highlights the human predicament, in a world of religious pluralism, of searching for the beloved who constantly upsets all human certainties." (Ankur Barua <i><i>H-Catholic</i></i>)<br><br>"This book is unlike any other I have read. Its distinctiveness resides in its profoundly spiritual theme, erudition, imaginative arrangement and engaging style . . . [S]o deftly does he move backwards and onwards between poetic universes&#x2015;impeccably integrating a medley of voices . . . [A] careful reading and patient reflection may well transform the reader . . . <i>His Hiding Place is Darkness</i> makes an outstanding contribution to comparative theology and religious hermeneutics." (Anita C. Ray <i><i>Australian eJournal of Theology</i></i>)<br><br>"In this slim, yet dense, volume, Francis X. Clooney, arguably the premier exponent-if not founder-of the discipline of comparative theology, continues his work of bridging the universes of Hinduism and Catholicism, theology and South Asian studies, and scholarly engagement and spiritual endeavour . . . Clooney, as always, ably demonstrates his brilliance, humanity, and erudition." (Thomas A. Forsthoefel <i><i>Religions of South Asia</i></i>)<br><br>"[I]ntersection and absence stand at the heart of this remarkable work, the latest by the Jesuit theologian Francis X. Clooney . . . Those who have followed Clooney across his prolific career will find much that is familiar in this volume: close, careful reading of primary texts in light of commentarial tradition, deep erudition, a post-modern sensibility, disdain for premature generalizations. The prose is crisp, insightful, and on several occasions, genuinely moving; the notes are extensive, detailed, and, in some cases, mildly polemical. The work as a whole, on the other hand, is startlingly original . . . [T]his represents Clooney's most convincing work since <i>Hindu God, Christian God</i>. It will richly reward careful study by students and scholars of comparative theology, theological aesthetics, and spirituality." (Reid B. Locklin <i><i>Journal of Religion</i></i>)<br><br>"Clooney's engaging style draws readers into two culturally, temporally, and linguistically different ancient poetic worlds. This humane and beautiful book is a work of great scholarship." (Gavin Flood <i>University of Oxford</i>)<br><br>"One of the great contributions of <i>His Hiding Place is Darkness</i> is that it is a text that skillfully and beautifully draws the reader into understanding that 'loving God is always a risk' . . . <i>His Hiding Place is Darkness</i> is a beautifully and skillfully written text and should be of interest to a wide variety of readers." (Rico G. Monge <i><i>Journal of Hindu-Christian Studies</i></i>)<br><br>"This work is remarkable on many counts. It presents a valuable development of comparative theology . . . It is clear that <i>His Hiding Place is Darkness</i> is richly reflected work, at the conclusion of which one has the impression of an enclyclopaedic treatment . . . The work is scholarly and objective, researched and original In style, but above all it is a pastoral work. In a world where some have no sense of the Divine, and where others seek but do not know what they are seeking or again where others are unable find the object of their quest or where the images of God are no longer effective, Clooney makes the point that the search is as revealing as the finding. In this way he shows that comparative theology is also a work of pastoral care. He goes far beyond the abstractions of religious studies to the needs of the modern world. <i>His Hiding Place is Darkness</i> not only satisfies the mind but also invites us to empathise with the needs of society."

They observed and documented scores of animals, including the Great Plains wolf, mule deer, prairie dogs, grizzly bears, and salmon. Several species and subspecies of mammals, birds, and fish previously unknown to science were recorded for the first time; the information gathered would serve as the basis of scientific study for years to come.<br>Collected here are stunning photographs by William Munoz that catalog the diverse array of wildlife witnessed by Lewis and Clark. Nature lovers and history buffs alike will be intrigued by this unusual account of the journey, whose bicentennial will soon be celebrated.

The coming bicentennial of the Corps of Discovery (1804-1806), better known as the Lewis and Clark expedition, has already inspired a number of books, but few as handsome as this one. The spacious page layouts, beautiful illustrations, and well-written text help ensure that this historically significant story will be read and enjoyed. Patent explains that President Jefferson sent out the Corps in hopes that the explorers would find a navigable waterway to the Pacific, establish good relations with Native Americans, and observe, describe, and collect specimens of animals "unknown to science." In this book, readers follow the expedition westward from the Mississippi, across the plains and the mountains to the Pacific, and back again. Patent tells the broader story well, but the strength of this book is its focus on the animals discovered by members of the expedition, as recorded in the journals of Lewis and Clark. Appended are the author's notes, which provide some of her sources and recommending resources for further reading, and a list of 121 species of vertebrate animals, indicating when and where the explorers first saw them. In addition to a few maps and reproductions of period paintings, Munoz's excellent color photographs of animals, landscape, artifacts, and sites offer vivid pictures of the world explored by the Corps of Discovery. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Accomplished artists, along with some of their famous pieces and techniques are presented, then followed up with an art project reminiscent of each artist's work or genre. Perfect for active young artists of all abilities, Get into Art! enables readers to discover a wealth of fine art and artists, as well as cultivate their own creativity. <i>Get into Art! Animals</i> by Susie Brooks explores a fascinating array of animal artworks from popular artists like Degas, Warhol, and Matisse. By introducing these artistic greats, their important works depicting animals, their style, genres, and techniques, including chalk pastel, stencil, collage, and mobile projects, Get into Art! Animals inspires readers to create masterpieces of their own. Included in each chapter are clear instructions for 12 intriguing and achievable art projects featuring animals from racehorses and cows to giraffe, birds, snails, and dragons, and plenty of works inspired after a featured artist.</p><p><p>Susie Brooks has a first class history of art degree and has worked as an editor and writer of children's non-fiction and picture books for over ten years. She's an artist herself and does occasional art workshops with young children.</p><p>Susie Brooks is also the creator of the artwork projects in this book.</p>*Starred Review* Brooks&#x2019; goal is to convince her readers that art is not just something one observes, but rather something that one does. Using a topic beloved by many kids&#x2014;animals&#x2014;she presents 13 works by famous artists, each of which incorporates animals into its subject and theme. Each reproduced masterpiece occupies its own two-page spread, and Brooks explores one major art technique for each. It&#x2019;s impossible not to be intrigued: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the first thing you notice in this picture?&#x201d; &#x201c;Have you ever seen things in a dream that wouldn&#x2019;t make sense in real life?&#x201d; Turn the flap, and the art lesson waits beneath to offer a hands-on approach to each broad concept. For example, Matisse&#x2019;s The Snail is accompanied by a project that explores drawing with scissors and finding patterns in creatures from nature. The projects range in difficulty from those with beginner&#x2019;s skills to those suited for more experienced young artists. A diverse selection of works of art, from Degas to totem poles to Ming pottery, is included, and an introductory discussion of major movements in visual art is incorporated into each explanation. Brooks believes that a deeper appreciation of high art can be had by kids, and this revelatory offering encourages them to find it.

He has written numerous books on murderers and serial killers. He was also the research and interviewer for a 13-part TV series in the Uk entitled <em>The Serial Killers</em>.From the time he was incarcerated, Arthur Shawcross consistently refused to be interviewed and it took several years of spasmodic correspondence before he changed his mind. When he did, the confirmation came in the form of a blunt, handwritten note, which said simply: 'I will see you.'<br>As part of the preparation for the interview, I set about talking to everyone who had been involved with Arthur's life and crimes, particularly Clara Neal, who, in her wisdom, feels that ARt should be released.<br>'I will keep him on tablets so he won't murder again,' she promised. 'Besides, we are getting married soon. I really love him. He is such a wonderfully gentle man.'<br>At 10:15am, Monday, 19 December 1994, the first interview started at the Sullivan Correctional Facility. Before being admitted into the serial killer's presence, the guards explained to me that Shawcross ws still considered a highly dangerous and formidable killing machine.<br>'He can revert to type within a microsecond,' they said. 'Should his features whiten, then tighten up, or should he break into a sweat, then get out of his way as fast as you can. He is strong enough to rip your head right off.' <br>Weighing in at around 20 stone, Arthur Shawcross is 5ft 11in tall. With a potato-shaped head topped with thin, silvery hair, a bulbous nose and small, black, ever-watery, pig-like eyes set close together, he is quite an intimidating sight. Massive arms hang from immensely strong sloping shoulders, his chest merging in a pot-belly which hangs over his belt. From his waist down, the shape of Shawcross is reversed. From the rolls of fat that circumnavigate his middle, he has short, stumpy legs that terminate in very small feet. All in all, one gets the impression that he is top-heavy and could topple over at any moment.<br>For the first of four interviews, we came face to face in a small locked cubicle. No one else was present while Shawcross was engrossed with eating his lunch. He greedily stuffed the food into his mouth, and his eyes were furtive, darting around as if someone was about to snatch his food away.<br>After he wiped the grease and food particles from his mouth, he was asked why he had eaten the body pats of many of his victims. Shawcross smiled, and said, 'Yes, sir, I have. The human meat, well, ah, it tastes like pork. I eat meat, uncooked meat, and it's like that. I eat hamburgers raw. I eat steak raw, an' I eat pork raw. I don't know why I ate parts of peopole, but I just did. Period.'<br>For a long moment, Shawcross fell silent. His podgy fingers fiddled nervously with a Styrofoam cup. His eyes scanned the ceiling as if he was searching for an invisible fly, then he added, 'Yeah, an' I ate another one with the bone. I just remeebered that.'<br>God, I thought. How can someone 'just remembered that'?<br>Although the truth of the matter is that Shawcross never fired a gun in anger while serving in Vietnam, he nevertheless wanted to boast about his service career during this period. TAlking about his favourite subject was a good way of gaining his confidence and, true to form, Shawcross came up with the goods. He explained that he had killed up to 50 people while out on what he called 'search and destroy missions'. He claimed, that he was tasked to destroy any living human he came across.<br>Despite the improbability of Arthur's gruesome acts, Arthur obviously enjoyed talking about them if only to cause shock waves. When pressed, this intellectual pygmy came up with a multitude of often-conflicting reasons in his efforts to mitigate his heinous behaviour. These ranged from various types of child abuse, especially incest, to his self-perceived Rambo-type activities carried out in Vietnam: 'The Army taught me how to kill. but it didn't teach me how not to kill. I have been a god unto myself. I've been the judge, the jury and the executioner. I have murdered, butchered and totally destroyed 53 human beings in my lifetime. I just wanna know why.'<br>Arthur's excuse for murdering prostitutes was equally bizarre. AT first, he stated that he was ordered by God to murder them because they all had AIDS. When questioned about the obvious fact that he had also raped and killed two young children, and two quite decent women, he clammed up and could not provide an answer. And, as the interviews progressed, he tripped himself up at every turn.<br>He admitted that he had murdered many of the women after having had sex with them. On another occasion, he strangled his victim because she bit his penis during fellatio, all of which somewhat flies in the face of him being ordered to kill them because they had AIDS. Another luckless sould he battered to a pulp after she had accidentally trapped her head in the window of his car. He went further to say that after dragging her two blocks, he stopped, and she calmly climbed into the car and asked him if he wanted sex. But, then, he changed his excuse once again: 'I went out with 80 to 100 women, including hookers. I was trying to find out why I was impotent, something like that.'<br>One girl had been murdered because she allegedly accused Art of stealing her purse. Antoher was slaughtered because she had stolen money from his home, and then threatened to tell Mrs. Shawcross that her husband was having an affair. Then Arthur argued that he was suffering from a rare genetic disorder, and this was why he turned to serial homicide, changing tack almost immediately to blame his four wives for denying him sex so that he had to go out and find hookers to kill. Finally, he said that bright lights give him terrible headaches, and this is the cause of his problems.<br>In an effort to tap into the black abyss of Shawcross's mind, I questioned him about the emotions he experienced prior to, and during the acts of murder. True to form, he did not disappoint with his answer.<br>'It was a combination of the quietness of the area, the starlight, an' I got sweating an' stuff. I can't control that. I strangled most of them, an' it ain't like on TV where they just drop dead. In real life, they can hold their breath for three minutes, and up to seven minutes before they suscumm [sic]. One woman, well, just as I was strangling her, she said, "I know who you are." Then she went limp an' she didn't feel nothing. She just went limp.'<br>Asked why some of his victims' bodies bore multiple bruising while some had been disembowelled and other had had vegetation debris forced into their body orifices, he started to become agitated. His fingers and hands constantly fidgeted, and his eyes darted around the room.<br>After a few moments, he regained his composure, replying 'Yes, sir. Some of the bodies, yeah, they had bruises on them. That's where I knelt over them with my body weight, or I dragged 'em into the rushes down by the water's edge. I cut 'em open so's they'd rot a lot quicker that way. Kinda gutted 'em like fish an' stuff. The other stuff. Well, I just don't need to talk with you about this just yet.'<br>Then he had the gall to ask me to be the Best Man at his forthcoming marriage to Clara Neal!<br></p><h2>China to Me</h2><p>A revolutionary woman for her time, Emily Hahn takes us on an adventure through the many faces that populate the landscape of China.

Hahn kept on fighting against the stereotype of female docility that characterized the Victorian era and was an advocate for the environment until her death at age ninety-two.<br><br> Emily Hahn (1905&#x2013;1997) was the author of fifty-two books, as well as one hundred eighty-one articles and short stories for the<i>&nbsp;New Yorker</i>&nbsp;from 1929 to 1996.

She wrote novels, short stories, personal essays, reportage, poetry, history and biography, natural history and zoology, cookbooks, humor, travel, children&#x2019;s books, and four autobiographical narratives:&nbsp;<i>China to Me</i>&nbsp;(1944), a literary exploration of her trip to China;<i>&nbsp;Hong Kong Holiday</i>&nbsp;(1946);&nbsp;<i>England to Me</i>&nbsp;(1949); and&nbsp;<i>Kissing Cousins</i>&nbsp;(1958).<br><br> The fifth of six children, she was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and later became the first woman to earn a degree in mining engineering at the University of Wisconsin. She did graduate work at both Columbia and Oxford before leaving for Shanghai. She lived in China for eight years. Her wartime affair with Charles Boxer, Britain&#x2019;s chief spy in pre&#x2013;World War II Hong Kong, evolved into a loving and unconventional marriage that lasted fifty-two years and produced two daughters. Emily Hahn&#x2019;s final published piece in the<i>&nbsp;New Yorker</i>&nbsp;appeared in 1996, shortly before her death.Hahn (Eve and the Apes) was considered scandalous when she published this 1944 memoir of her nine years in China and Hong Kong. Contemporary readers will discover that the keen prose is suffused with an intellectual freedom and freshness of perspective that vivify the concerns of a long-gone world. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>1966: The Year the Decade Exploded</h2><p>The pop world accelerated and broke through the sound barrier in 1966. In America, in London, in Amsterdam, in Paris, revolutionary ideas slow-cooking since the late '50s reached boiling point. In the worlds of pop, pop art, fashion, and radical politics -- often fueled by perception-enhancing substances and literature -- the "Sixties", as we have come to know them, hit their Modernist peak.

Julian Rothenstein (creator of our Gift division s popular Redstone line of cards and calendars) turns his idiosyncratic eye towards eccentric alphabets, emblems, and logos discovered in avant-garde modernist publications and other curious sources. Hundreds of examples of graphic ephemera sit side-by-side in inimitable Redstone fashion, mixing peculiar charm with useful reference in one stunning package. Special features include an amazing alphabet, circa 1926, created from photographs of a dancing woman; original test-types for opticians charts; pages from sign artists manuals; and coolly elegant designs from fin de si cle French, German, Italian, and Czech journals. Nearly all of this rare and beautiful material is reproduced here for the first time since its original publication. An art book like no other, ABZ is a collection of typographic oddities taken to the next level of appreciation.</p><p>Julian Rothenstein is a great gatherer and arranger of aged, amusing, bizarre, and beatiful art and artifacts. Proprietor of Redstone Press of London, he has unleashed many wonderfully weird books, calendars, and notecards on the world at large.<br><br>Mel Gooding is an art critic, writer, and curator who has contributed extensively to magazines and newspapers.Typeface demo sheets, eye charts and logos come together to create a lush, idiosyncratic catalogue of visual ephemera as chosen by Rothenstein, a designer, and Gooding, an art critic and curator. They present forgotten modernist lettering, from Italian Futurist and Russian Constructivist graphics to Czech Karel Teige's 1926 "living poem" (of typeface combined with illustrative photography of a dancer); "The Antifascist Schoolbook," a rebellious, late 1930s graphic text against Spain's General Franco; and advertisements for everything from tea to caviar. Each large page is striking in its muted, silkscreened colors, and the book itself is beautiful, with rounded corners, yellow edges and green splotchy endpapers. Very little text intervenes, with only small introductions to the five chapters. Gooding suggests in his introduction, "There is indeed something quite magical about the look of the alphabet: it has to do with its infinite capacity to change shape and style, to express purpose and suggest mood, to be formal and informal, elegant and ugly, classical and romantic, delicate and robust." Rescued from among thousands, the alphabets here provide us with the subtitle's "More," and bear out that infinitude beautifully. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sethra Lavode (The Viscount of Adrilankha)</h2><p>She's the oldest person in the Dragaeran Empire, a military genius and master of sorcery whose own story stretches back to before the dawn of history. She's Sethra Lavode, the undead Enchantress of Dzur Mountain. Now, after a long absence, she's returned to take an active role in the Empire's affairs&#x2014;and the affairs of Khaavren, Pel, Tazendra, Aerich, and all their friends and relations.&nbsp;Since the day Adron's Disaster reduced Dragaera City to a barren sea of amorphia, the Empire has been in ruins. The Emperor is gone, along with the Orb that was both his badge of office and the source of the magical power that in former times was practically a public utility. Trade has collapsed. Brigands rule the roads. Plagues sweep through the population. And an ambitious Dragonlord has moved to rebuild the Empire&#x2014;in his own name, of course.&nbsp;Unknown to him, Sethra Lavode has already helped the Phoenix Zerika, true heir to the throne, retrieve the Orb from the Paths of the Dead. Sethra means to see Zerika on the throne. But making it so will entail a climactic battle of sorcery and arms. &nbsp;<i>Sethra Lavode</i>, Book Three of The Viscount of Adrilankha, is an epic fantasy&#x2014;told with all the swashbuckling flair for which Steven Brust is known.</p><p>Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and raised in a family of Hungarian labor organizers, Steven Brust worked as a musician and a computer programmer before coming to prominence as a writer in 1983 with <i>Jhereg</i>, the first of his novels about Vlad Taltos, a human professional assassin in a world dominated by long-lived, magically-empowered human-like "Dragaerans." <br><br>Over the next several years, several more "Taltos" novels followed, interspersed with other work, including <i>To Reign in Hell</i>, a fantasy re-working of Milton's war in Heaven; <i>The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars</i>, a contemporary fantasy based on Hungarian folktales; and a science fiction novel, <i>Cowboy Feng's Space Bar and Grille</i>. The most recent "Taltos" novels are <i>Dragon</i> and<i> Issola</i>. In 1991, with <i>The Phoenix Guards</i>, Brust began another series, set a thousand years earlier than the Taltos books; its sequels are <i>Five Hundred Years After</i> and the three volumes of "The Viscount of Adrilankha": <i>The Paths of the Dead, The Lord of Castle Black, </i>and<i> Sethra Lavode</i>.<br><br>While writing, Brust has continued to work as a musician, playing drums for the legendary band Cats Laughing and recording an album of his own work, A Rose for Iconoclastes. He lives in Las Vegas, Nevada where he pursues an ongoing interest in stochastics. <br>Chapter the Sixty-Ninth<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>How the Empress, Attempting to</i><br><i>Work on the Design of the Imperial Palace,</i><br><i>Manages Those Who Interrupt Her</i><br>&nbsp;<br>On the ground floor of Whitecrest Manor was a wide enclosed terrace, the twin to the open terrace on the other side where the Count and Countess of Whitecrest were accustomed to take their morning klava and watch the ocean. The enclosed terrace, of course, was used during inclement weather and had been the place where the Countess was accustomed to carry on her work--except that now it was the room where the Empress was carrying on her official business. The room was reached by a hallway with two entrances, one leading down to the parlor, and the other to a flight of steps that went up to the second story of the Manor. This second entrance had been sealed off, and a guard was posted at the first, with instructions to admit no one without permission of either Her Majesty or the officer on duty.<br>The officer on duty, of course, was generally Khaavren, and it happened to be Khaavren on this day who entered the room, bowed to Zerika, and said, "A gentleman to see Your Majesty. It is Prince Tiwall, of the House of the Hawk."<br>"Ah!" said Zerika, looking up from the papers she had been studying, which papers were, in turn, a single entry in a seemingly endless list of details to be decided upon with regard to the design of the Imperial Palace. Before her were not only lists and diagrams, but several different models of the future structures, or portions there-of, one of which was a full five feet high and more than fifteen feet in length, and occupied most of the room.<br>This activity had taken up so much of Her Majesty's time and effort that she was often impatient with any interruptions. On hearing who was there, the Orb, which had been circling her head with a beige color of distraction, first turned to a faint red of irritation, then, after she had reflected, to a warm orange of pleasurable excitement. "Send him in at once," she said.<br>Khaavren bowed and, as he had been trained to do for so long, did as he was told.<br>"I greet Your Majesty," said Tiwall, a stern, forbidding gentleman of well over two thousand years, whose white hair, worn long and brushed back from his noble's point, made a stark contrast to his dark complexion.<br>"Come, Your Highness," said Zerika. "That isn't so bad. You greet me as Your Majesty. Does this mean that I have cause to hope the House of the Hawk looks with favor upon my claim?"<br>Tiwall bowed. "I use the title because of my own belief, madam, that the Orb is the Empire."<br>"Your own belief--what of your House?"<br>"Oh, as to my House--"<br>"Well?"<br>"They are considering the matter."<br>"Considering it?"<br>"Your Majesty must understand that these are difficult times, and no one wishes to be hasty."<br>"Yet, Your Highness has decided."<br>"I have, and I beg Your Majesty to believe that I am using all of my influence within the House on your behalf."<br>"I am glad to hear it. For my part, I shall be glad to use what influence I have on Your Highness's behalf."<br>"Oh, if Your Majesty means that--"<br>"Yes?" said Zerika, frowning.<br>"It could be of immeasurable help in that cause in which we are united."<br>"I do not understand what Your Highness does me the honor to tell me. Speak more plainly, I beg."<br>"I only wish to say that should Your Majesty act on my behalf, or, more precisely, on behalf of my House, it would be of great help to me in convincing them."<br>&nbsp;Zerika looked at him carefully. "Does the House of the Hawk wish to bargain with the Empire?"<br>"It is their contention--and believe me, I speak of them, not of me--that, not having been recognized by the Council of Princes, it is not yet the Empire."<br>"I see. So, then, the House of the Hawk wishes to bargain with a certain Phoenix who happens to have the Orb circling her head."<br>"Your Majesty has stated the situation admirably."<br>"I see. And what does the House of the Hawk feel this recognition is worth?"<br>"If Your Majesty will permit me, before I answer the question you have done me the honor to ask."<br>"Permit you to what, Highness?"<br>"To explain the situation as I see it. Perhaps there are aspects that I fail to understand."<br>"I doubt that," murmured Zerika. Then she said, "Very well, Prince. State the situation as you understand it."<br>Tiwall bowed and said, "Well, let us see. You already have approval of the Lyorn, have you not?"<br>"The Count of Flowerpot Hill and Environs came to Adrilankha within days of my arrival here, and at once pledged the support of his House."<br>"And of course, you have the support of the House of the Phoenix."<br>"As I am the only one in the House, yes, it is true that I gave myself my full support. And I even plan to continue doing so."<br>"But Your Majesty has not yet heard from the Dragon or the Athyra, which are, I should point out, the two most powerful Houses."<br>"Again, you are correct."<br>"It must be said that the indications of allegiance you have received from the Tiassa are important. They have influence."<br>"I received a letter only yester-day from Count R�aanac in which he informs me of the decision of his House and pledges his personal good-will. Your Highness is singularly well informed."<br>Tiwall bowed and said, "So then, will Your Majesty permit me to make an observation?"<br>"Certainly, Highness. Do so, by all means, especially if it brings us to the point of this political survey you have just made for my benefit."<br>Tiwall, after clearing his throat, said, "My House occupies an unusual middle ground. We have more influence than the Jhereg and the Teckla, but not so much as the Dragon and the Athyra. We have been consulted--informally, I should add--by parties from the Issola and the Iorich, as well as certain of the merchant Houses."<br>"Very well, go on."<br>"Should I manage to persuade my House to accept Your Majesty as the Empress that you are, well--"<br>"Yes, if you should convince them, as I know you are trying to do?"<br>"I am certain we would bring with us, as a matter of course, the Iorich, the Chreotha, and most probably the Orca as well."<br>"I see."<br>"Once that happens, I cannot imagine the Jhereg and the Teckla not falling into line."<br>"It seems as if Your Highness is doing my planning for me."<br>"Not in the least, Your Majesty. I'm attempting to explain--"<br>"Never mind, Highness. Go on."<br>"Yes, Your Majesty. I wish only to observe that, should my negotiations within my own House be successful, it may have the effect, by itself, of very nearly bringing the entire Council of Princes to Your Majesty's support."<br>Zerika remained silent, and the Orb, slowing down a trifle in response to this contemplation, took on a dark green shade as she considered, as well as flickering slightly when she consulted it for some detail on Tiwall's history or family. To be sure, this Hawklord was no one's fool, and he was, as Hawks always are, well informed. But how honest was he, within the lies he was telling that were meant to be seen through?<br>"Very well," said Zerika after a moment. "What might the Empire grant your House that could help you to convince them that I am the true Empress, representing their interests as well as everyone else's within the vast Empire that we once had and, with the Favor, will again?"<br>"Tolerably little, Majesty."<br>"We shall see."<br>"An estate."<br>"That is easy enough; there are many estates."<br>"A particular estate, Majesty."<br>"Then that is different. Who owns it now?"<br>"No one. That is to say, the Empire."<br>"So much the better. Is it valuable?"<br>"I will not deny to Your Majesty that it is."<br>"What is its value?"<br>"Nowhere else that I know of are iron ore, oil, and coal all to be found in the same, narrow region of a few small mountains and valleys. There are refining operations near-by where, before the disaster, kerosene was produced, and there is no shortage of waterways."<br>"And you say, these counties are not owned?"<br>"Not one of them. A few had a baron or two ruling part of them before the Disaster, but since then not even a younger son of any of them remain."<br>"How many counties are we speaking of?"<br>"Five"<br>"How much in area?"<br>"Perhaps twelve hundred square miles."<br>"That is not so much. Where are these counties, exactly?"<br>"Just south of the Collier Hills."<br>"Ah, ah!"<br>"Your Majesty knows them?"<br>"Nearly. I have just promised three of them to a certain Dragonlord who gave me some assistance against the Pretender. I had no idea they were so valuable."<br>"You have promised them? Ah, that is too bad!"<br>"Is there nothing else that will do?"<br>"I fear not, Your Majesty," said the Hawk, bowing deeply. "If I may be excused--"<br>"Your Highness may not," said Zerika coldly.<br>Tiwall bowed again, and waited in the perfect attitude of the courtier.<br>The Empress was discovering, as Morrolan had, that to govern others requires one to spend more time in consideration than one is used to--either that, or one must inevitably become a careless administrator, and history says nothing good about careless administrators. Therefore, Zerika considered, and, after considering, she said, "Very well, you may have your five counties."<br>The Hawklord bowed. "I believe I will be able to bring Your Majesty good news within a month."<br>"I depend upon it."<br>"Oh," he said, suddenly looking worried. "I hope Your Majesty did not interpret my words as a guarantee for any House other than my own."<br>"I hope," replied the Empress, "that Your Highness did not interpret my words as a guarantee of five counties to be given to your House."<br>"And yet--I understand, Your Majesty."<br>"That is good, Highness. It is important to understand one another."<br>Tiwall bowed to acknowledge this observation Her Majesty did him the honor to share, and inquired, "Will there be anything else?"<br>"No. You may go."<br>"Your Majesty will hear from me soon."<br>When he was gone, Zerika returned to her work, comparing certain figures on paper to some of the models and drumming her fingertips on the table, until the captain once again entered the room, and said, "Another gentleman begs to have a word with Your Majesty."<br>Zerika had been reflecting on what sort of passageway ought to connect the Imperial Wing with the Iorich Wing, which included certain philosophical issues about the relationship between the needs of the Empire and the abstraction of justice and therefore could not be easily delegated. She permitted a grimace to cross her countenance as she said, "Who is it this time?"<br>"It is I," said Khaavren.<br>"Yes, yes. But I mean, who wishes to see me?"<br>"The captain of your guard," said Khaavren coolly.<br>"But you are the captain of my guard."<br>"Then, it appears, it is I who wish to have a word with my Empress."<br>Her Majesty's eyes narrowed, and she said, "You must break yourself of this habit, Captain, of answering in tones that might be construed as deficient in respect for the Orb. Even when we are alone, I do not consider it in the best of taste, and I am surprised that an old soldier such as yourself, who has served the Empire for so many years, would permit himself such liberties."<br>"I beg Your Majesty's pardon," said Khaavren. "With age, we soldiers become brittle, and the least pressure upon us causes us to snap back quickly lest we break."<br>"I do not believe, Captain, that you are in any danger of breaking."<br>"I beg Your Majesty's pardon, but I must do myself the honor of disagreeing."<br>"You say, then, that you are in danger of breaking?"<br>"Your Majesty must know that I am old."<br>Zerika quickly consulted the Orb, and did some fast arithmetic, after which she said, "My dear Captain, you have not seen a thousand years."<br>"That is true, but Your Majesty ought to understand that each year of Interregnum, now thankfully passed--"<br>"As to that, we shall see, with the Favor."<br>"--must count as ten years when calculating my age."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>"So many?"<br>"At the very least."<br>"Well, perhaps the Tiassa do not reckon figures as others do."<br>"That may be; but I swear it is the truth."<br>"Very well, then, Captain, I accept that you are old. What of it? Your service is still valuable."<br>"Oh, it is good of Your Majesty to say so."<br>"Not at all. I hope, at least, you do not dispute me on this as well?"<br>"Alas--"<br>"What, you say that you are no longer useful to me?"<br>"I am old, Your Majesty, and tired. I feel that, in having the honor to have served Your Majesty in so far as arriving to Adrilankha, I have done my duty."<br>"So then? What are you saying, Captain. Speak plainly."<br>"Your Majesty, I wish to offer you my resignation."<br>"What? I cannot believe it! You? Resign?"<br>"It is my fondest wish, Majesty."<br>"You offer your resignation."<br>"Exactly."<br>"And if I do not accept it?"<br>"Then I must find a way to convince Your Majesty to do so." He placed a paper on the table in front of her. "Here are a list of certain of my officers in whom I have great confidence; some of them were with me before the Disaster. Any of them can easily step into my boots."<br>"But why, Captain? Come, speak frankly."<br>"I have already had the honor to do so."<br>Zerika looked at the soldier carefully, noting his unbent posture, the attitude of humble respect that can only come from one who is secure of his own place, the lines of sorrow and joy on his face. At length, she said, "My lord, you are not being entirely honest with me."<br>"Your Majesty?"<br>"Do you require me to repeat myself?"<br>"I heard, but I do not understand."<br>"What could be plainer? I believe that you wish to resign, but I do not believe you have told me the true reason."<br>"I can only do myself the honor of repeating myself to Your Majesty, and, as that might be considered disrespectful, I must refrain from doing so, wherefore I stand mute."<br>"Permit me to observe, Captain, that you require more words to stand mute than you should have required to answer my question. So now I do myself the honor of asking again. Why do you wish to leave my service? Does it have something to do with your son, with whom you have quarreled?"<br>At these words, Khaavren stiffened almost imperceptibly, but he looked the Empress fully in the face and said, "No."<br>"Well then, what is the reason?"<br>Khaavren bowed his head and stood mute, this time without accompanying explanations.<br>The Orb turned to a dark, forbidding red, and Zerika slapped her palm upon the table. "Very well, then, Captain. You have tendered your resignation; I accept it. Farewell."<br>Khaavren bowed low to Her Majesty, and turning crisply on his heel, left the Empress's presence at a good, martial pace, which carried him, after two steps, to the Countess's apartment. The door being open, he passed within. Daro--whom we confess to our shame has been unfairly neglected by this history--had been, since giving the Manor over to Her Majesty, using the small secretary to carry out the business of the county. She looked up from this work as Khaavren entered, and stood up, smiling. Khaavren at once approached her and tenderly kissed her hand.<br>"It is such a pleasure, Countess, to be home, because I am able to see you every day."<br>"I give you my word, sir, that I share fully in this pleasure. But come, do not s...</p><h2>Jump-rope rhymes, a dictionary (Publications of the American Folklore Society)</h2><p>Jump Rope Rhymes: A Dictionary (Publications of the American Folklore Society) [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>Majestic Lights: The Aurora in Science, History, and the Arts (Special Publications)</h2><p><p>Published by the American Geophysical Union as part of the <i>Special Publications Series</i>.<br> <br> The atmosphere being heavier in the polar regions, than in the equatorial, will there be lower; as well as from that cause, as from the smaller effect of the centrifugal force: consequently the distance of the vacuum above the atmosphere will be less at the poles, than elsewhere;...May not then the great quantity of electricity, brought into the polar regions by clouds, which are condensed there, and fall in snow, which electricity would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice; may it not, I say, break through that low atmosphere, and run along in the vacuum over the air and towards the equator; diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge; strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled with their upper air.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So wrote Benjamin Franklin (176), L.L.D., F.R.S., in a paper read to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris at the meeting held immediately after Easter in 1779.

Now it had been turned into a yuppie, preppy, master-of- the-universe, poser asshat bar, loaded up with guys who sported crisp white shirts under black suits, two-day stubble, manscaped to the max to look un- manscaped. They smirked a lot, these soft men, their hair moussed to the point of overcoif, and ordered Ketel One instead of Grey Goose because they watched some TV ad telling them that was what real men drink.</p><p>Stacy&#x2019;s eyes started darting around the bar. Avoidance. Kat didn&#x2019;t like that.</p><p>&#x201c;What did you do?&#x201d; Kat asked. &#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; Stacy said.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A Punch-Worthy at five o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;</p><p>Kat swiveled to the right to take a peek. &#x201c;See him?&#x201d; Stacy asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah.&#x201d;</p><br><p>D�cor-wise, O&#x2019;Malley&#x2019;s hadn&#x2019;t really changed much over the years. Sure, the old console TVs had been replaced by a host of flat- screens showing too wide a variety of games&#x2014;who cared about how the Edmonton Oilers did?&#x2014;but outside of that, O&#x2019;Malley had kept the cop feel and that was what had appealed to these posers, the faux authenticity, moving in and pushing out what had made the place hum, turning it into some Disney Epcot version of what it had once been.</p><p>Kat was the only cop left in here. The others now went home after their shifts, or to AA meetings. Kat still came and tried to sit quietly on her father&#x2019;s old stool with the ghosts, especially tonight, with her father&#x2019;s murder haunting her anew. She just wanted to be here, to feel her father&#x2019;s presence, to&#x2014;corny as it sounded&#x2014;gather strength from it.</p><p>But the douche bags wouldn&#x2019;t let her be, would they?</p><p>This particular Punch-Worthy&#x2014;shorthand for any guy deserving a fist to the face&#x2014;had committed a classic punch-worthy sin. He was wearing sunglasses. At eleven o&#x2019;clock at night. In a bar with poor lighting. Other punch-worthy indictments included wearing a chain on your wallet, do-rags, unbuttoned silk shirts, an overabun- dance of tattoos (special category for those sporting tribal symbols), dog tags when you didn&#x2019;t serve in the military, and really big white wristwatches.</p><p>Sunglasses smirked and lifted his glass toward Kat and Stacy. &#x201c;He likes us,&#x201d; Stacy said.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop stalling. What won&#x2019;t I like?&#x201d;</p><p>When Stacy turned back toward her, Kat could see over her shoul- der the disappointment on Punch-Worthy&#x2019;s glistening-with-overpriced- lotion face. Kat had seen that look a zillion times before. Men liked Stacy. That was probably something of an understatement. Stacy was frighteningly, knee-knockingly, teeth-and-bone-and-metal-meltingly hot. Men became both weak-legged and stupid around Stacy. Mostly stupid. Really, really stupid.</p><br><p>This was why it was probably a mistake to hang out with some- one who looked like Stacy &#x2014;guys often concluded that they had no shot when a woman looked like that. She seemed unapproachable.</p><p>Kat, in comparison, did not.</p><p>Sunglasses honed in on Kat and began to make his move. He didn&#x2019;t so much walk toward her as glide on his own slime.</p><p>Stacy suppressed a giggle. &#x201c;This is going to be good.&#x201d;</p><p>Hoping to discourage him, Kat gave the guy flat eyes and a dis- dainful frown. Sunglasses was not deterred. He bebopped over, mov- ing to some sound track that was playing only in his own head.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, babe,&#x201d; Sunglasses said. &#x201c;Is your name Wi-Fi?&#x201d; Kat waited.</p><p>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m feeling a connection.&#x201d; Stacy burst out laughing.</p><p>Kat just stared at him. He continued.</p><p>&#x201c;I love you small chicks, you know? You&#x2019;re kinda adorable. A</p><p>spinner, am I right? You know what would look good on me? You.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do these lines ever work?&#x201d; Kat asked him.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not done yet.&#x201d; Sunglasses coughed into his fist, took out his iPhone, and held it up to Kat. &#x201c;Hey, babe, congrats&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve just moved to the top of my to-do list.&#x201d;</p><p>Stacy loved it.</p><p>Kat said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;Whatever you want it to be, babe.&#x201d; &#x201c;How about Ass Waffle?&#x201d; Kat opened her blazer, showing the</p><p>weapon on her belt. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to reach for my gun now, Ass Waffle.&#x201d; &#x201c;Damn, woman, are you my new boss?&#x201d; He pointed to his crotch.</p><p>&#x201c;Because you just gave me a raise.&#x201d; &#x201c;Go away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My love for you is like diarrhea,&#x201d; Sunglasses said. &#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t hold it in.&#x201d;</p><p>Kat stared at him, horrified. &#x201c;Too far?&#x201d; he said.</p><br><p>&#x201c;Oh man, that&#x2019;s just gross.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, but I bet you never heard it before.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d win that bet. &#x201c;Leave. Now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p><p>Stacy was nearly on the floor with laughter.</p><p>Sunglasses started to turn away. &#x201c;Wait. Is this a test? Is Ass Waffle, like, a compliment or something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go.&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged, turned, spotted Stacy, figured why not. He looked her long body up and down and said, &#x201c;The word of the day is legs. Let&#x2019;s go back to your place and spread the word.&#x201d;</p><p>Stacy was still loving it. &#x201c;Take me, Ass Waffle. Right here. Right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; &#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>Ass Waffle looked back at Kat. Kat put her hand on the butt of her gun. He held up his hands and slinked away.</p><p>Kat said, &#x201c;Stacy?&#x201d; &#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why do these guys keep thinking they have a chance with me?&#x201d; &#x201c;Because you look cute and perky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not perky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, but you look perky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seriously, do I look like that much of a loser?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You look damaged,&#x201d; Stacy said. &#x201c;I hate to say it. But the damage . . . it comes off you like some kind of pheromone that douche bags can&#x2019;t resist.&#x201d;</p><p>They both took a sip of their drinks. &#x201c;So what won&#x2019;t I like?&#x201d; Kat asked.</p><p>Stacy looked back toward Ass Waffle. &#x201c;I feel bad for him now. Maybe I should throw him a quickie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t start.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Stacy crossed her show-off long legs and smiled at Ass Waffle. He made a face that reminded Kat of a dog left in a car too long. &#x201c;Do you think this skirt is too short?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Skirt?&#x201d; Kat said. &#x201c;I thought it was a belt.&#x201d;</p><p>Stacy liked that. She loved the attention. She loved picking up men, because she thought a one-night stand with her was somehow life changing for them. It was also part of her job. Stacy owned a private investigation firm with two other gorgeous women. Their specialty? Catching (really, entrapping) cheating spouses.</p><p>&#x201c;Stacy?&#x201d; &#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What won&#x2019;t I like?&#x201d; &#x201c;This.&#x201d;</p><p>Still teasing Ass Waffle, Stacy handed Kat a piece of paper. Kat looked at the paper and frowned:</p><p><i>KD8115</i></p><p><i>HottestSexEvah</i></p><p>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;KD8115 is your user name.&#x201d; Her initials and badge number.</p><p>&#x201c;HottestSexEvah is your password. Oh, and it&#x2019;s case sensitive.&#x201d; &#x201c;And these are for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A website. YouAreJustMyType.com.&#x201d; &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an online dating service.&#x201d;</p><p>Kat made a face. &#x201c;Please tell me you&#x2019;re joking.&#x201d; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s upscale.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they say about strip clubs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I bought you a subscription,&#x201d; Stacy said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good for a year.&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t kid. I do some work for this company. They&#x2019;re good. And let&#x2019;s not fool ourselves. You need someone. You want someone. And you aren&#x2019;t going to find him in here.&#x201d;</p><p>Kat sighed, rose, and nodded to the bartender, a guy named Pete</p><br><p>who looked like a character actor who always played the Irish bar- tender&#x2014;which is what, in fact, he was. Pete nodded back, indicating that he&#x2019;d put the drinks on Kat&#x2019;s tab.</p><p>&#x201c;Who knows?&#x201d; Stacy said. &#x201c;You could end up meeting Mr. Right.&#x201d; Kat started for the door. &#x201c;But more likely, Mr. Ass Waffle.&#x201d;</p><p>Kat typed in &#x201c;YouAreJustMyType.com,&#x201d; hit the return button, and filled in her new user name and the rather embarrassing pass- word. She frowned when she saw the moniker at the top of the profile that Stacy had chosen for her:</p><p>Cute and perky!</p><p>&#x201c;She left off <i>damaged</i>,&#x201d; Kat muttered under her breath.</p><p>It was past midnight, but Kat wasn&#x2019;t much of a sleeper. She lived in an area far too upscale for her&#x2014;West 67th Street off Central Park West, in the Atelier. A hundred years ago, this and its neighboring buildings, including the famed Hotel des Artistes, had housed writ- ers, painters, intellectuals&#x2014;artists. The spacious old-world apart- ments faced the street, the smaller artist studios in the back. Eventually, the old art studios were converted into one-bedroom apartments. Kat&#x2019;s father, a cop who watched his friends get rich doing nothing but buying real estate, tried to find his way in. A guy whose life Dad had saved sold him the place on the cheap.</p><p>Kat had first used it as an undergrad at Columbia University. She had paid for her Ivy League education with an NYPD scholarship. According to the life plan, she was then supposed to go to law school and join a big white-shoe firm in New York City, finally breaking away from the cursed family legacy of police work.</p><p>Alas, it hadn&#x2019;t worked out that away.</p><p>A glass of red wine sat next to her keyboard. Kat drank too much. She knew that was a clich�&#x2014;a cop who drank too much&#x2014;but sometimes the clich�s are there for a reason. She functioned fine. She didn&#x2019;t drink on the job. It didn&#x2019;t really affect her life in any notice- able way, but if Kat made calls or even decisions late at night, they tended to be, er, sloppy ones. She had learned over the years to turn off her mobile phone and stay away from e-mail after ten p.m.</p><p>Yet here she was, late at night, checking out random dudes on a dating website.</p><p>Stacy had uploaded four photographs to Kat&#x2019;s page. Kat&#x2019;s profile picture, a head shot, had been cropped from a bridesmaid group photo taken at a wedding last year. Kat tried to view herself objec- tively, but that was impossible. She hated the picture. The woman in the photograph looked unsure of herself, her smile weak, almost as though she were waiting to be slapped or something. Every photograph&#x2014;now that she went through the painful ritual of view- ing them&#x2014;had been cropped from group pictures, and in every one, Kat looked as though she were half wincing.</p><p>Okay, enough of her own profile.</p><p>On the job, the only men she met were cops. She didn&#x2019;t want a cop. Cops were good men and horrible husbands. She knew that only too well. When Grandma got terminally ill, her grandfather, unable to handle it, ran off until, well, it was too late. Pops never forgave himself for that. That was Kat&#x2019;s theory anyway. He was lonely and while he had been a hero to many, Pops chickened out when it counted most and he couldn&#x2019;t live with that and his service revolver was sitting right there, right on the same top shelf in the kitchen where he&#x2019;d always kept it, and so one night, Kat&#x2019;s grand- father reached up and took his piece down from the shelf and sat by himself at the kitchen table and . . .</p><p>Ka-boom.</p><p>Dad too would go on benders and disappear for days at a time. Mom would be extra cheery when this happened&#x2014;which made it all the more scary and creepy&#x2014;either pretending Dad was on an under- cover mission or ignoring his disappearance altogether, literally out of sight, out of mind, and then, maybe a week later, Dad would waltz in with a fresh shave and a smile and a dozen roses for Mom, and everyone would act like this was normal.</p><p>YouAreJustMyType.com. She, the cute and perky Kat Donovan, was on an Internet dating site. Man oh man, talk about the best-laid plans. She lifted the wineglass, made a toasting gesture toward the computer screen, and took too big a gulp.</p><p>The world sadly was no longer conducive to meeting a life part- ner. Sex, sure. That was easy. That was, in fact, the expectation, the elephant in the date room, and while she loved the pleasures of the flesh as much as the next gal, the truth was, when you went to bed with someone too quickly, rightly or wrongly, the chances of a long- term relationship took a major hit. She didn&#x2019;t put a moral judgment on this. It was just the way it was.</p><p>Her computer dinged. A message bubble popped up:</p><p>We have matches for you! Click here to see someone who might be perfect for you!</p><p>Kat finished the glass of wine. She debated pouring another, but really, enough. She took stock of herself and realized an obvious yet unspoken truth: She wanted someone in her life. Have the courage to admit that to yourself, okay? Much as she strove to be indepen- dent, Kat wanted a man, a partner, someone in her bed at night. She didn&#x2019;t pine or force it or even make much of an effort. But she wasn&#x2019;t really built to be alone.</p><p>She began to click through the profiles. You&#x2019;ve got to be in it to win it, right?</p><p>Pathetic.</p><p>Some men could be eliminated with a quick glance at their profile photograph. It was key when you thought about it. The profile por- trait each man had painstakingly chosen was, in pretty much every way, the first (very controlled) impression. It thus spoke volumes.</p><br><p>So: If you made the conscious choice to wear a fedora, that was an automatic no. If you chose not to wear a shirt, no matter how well built you were, automatic no. If you had a Bluetooth in your ear&#x2014;gosh, aren&#x2019;t <i>you </i>important?&#x2014;automatic no. If you had a soul patch or sported a vest or winked or made hand gestures or chose a tangerine-hued shirt (personal bias) or balanced your sunglasses on top of your head, automatic no, no, no. If your profile name was Man- Stallion, SexySmile, RichPrettyBoy, LadySatisfier&#x2014;you get the gist.</p><p>Kate clicked open a few where the guy looked . . . approachable, she guessed. There was a sad, depressing sameness to all the write-ups. Every person on the website enjoyed walks on a beach and dining out and exercising and exotic travel and wine tasting and theater and museums and being active and taking chances and grand adventures&#x2014; yet they were equally content with staying home and watching a movie, coffee and conversation, cooking, reading a book, the simple pleasures. Every guy claimed that the most important quality they looked for in a woman was a sense of humor&#x2014;right, sure&#x2014;to the point where Kat wondered whether &#x201c;sense of humor&#x201d; was a euphe- mism for &#x201c;big boobs.&#x201d; Of course, every man also listed preferred body type as athletic, slender, <i>and </i>curvy.</p><p>That seemed more accurate, if not downright wishful.</p><p>The profiles never reflected reality. Rather than being what you are, they were a wonderful if not futile exercise in what you <i>think </i>you are or what you want a potential partner to think you are&#x2014;or most likely, the profiles (and, man, shrinks would have a field day) simply reflect what you want to be.</p><p>The personal statements were all over the place, but if she had to use one word to sum them up, it would probably be <i>treacle</i>. The first read, &#x201c;Every morning, life is a blank canvas waiting to be painted&#x201d;&#x2014; click. Some aimed for honest by telling you repeatedly that they were honest. Some faked sincerity. Some were highfalutin or show- boating or insecure or needy. Just like real life, when Kat thought about it. Most were simply trying too hard. The stench of desperation came off the screen in squiggly, bad- cologne waves. The con- stant soul-mate talk was, at best, off-putting. In real life, Kat thought, none of us can find someone we want to go out with more than onc...</p></p><h2>A Little Guide to Wild Flowers</h2><p>An indispensable guide to the wild flowers that you see every day: by the road, as garden weeds, or between the cracks in the pavement&#x2014;as well as on trips to the country or seaside.&nbsp;Arranged in color for speedy identification, with extra anecdotes from winsome characters in Charlotte Voake&#x2019;s inimitable style, this child-friendly guide also includes keynotes on plant parts and the seasons.</p><p><b>Charlotte Voake</b> is an internationally acclaimed children&#x2019;s author and artist.&nbsp;She recently won the Smarties Silver Medal Award for her picture book, <i>The Pizza Kitten</i>."Beautiful introduction to British wildflowers."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Glasgow Herald </i><br><br>"Combining an informal yet informative text with hundreds of exquisite watercolour illustrations . . .it's a winning combination. . . .

Visit jamielangstonturner.com for more information.<i>Starred Review.</i> With this fictional octogenarian's rich reflection on her disappointing life, Christy Award&#x2013;winner Turner pens her best novel in years. Bitterness over her late husband and his secret addiction to pornography has colored Sophia Hess's view of everything she's trusted and held dear. Dangling the promise of leaving her money to whichever distant relative cares for her, "Aunt Sophie" takes up residence in the spare room belonging to her loquacious, pontificating nephew, Patrick, and his diffident wife, Rachel, in Greenville, Miss. They collect a ragtag group of acquaintances, including an ex-con and a severely disabled four-year-old who flit in and out of the story. Sophie, a former English teacher, passes her days mostly by reading obituaries, watching television and learning about the birds outside her window. Turner brilliantly weaves together the threads of Shakespeare's plays, sitcoms, birds and their habits, and the deaths of celebrities gleaned from Time magazine's obituary section as she unfolds the story. As she did in <i>Some Wildflower in My Heart</i>, Turner shows how even the most awkward and imperfect love, care and attention can yield meaningful results. Readers may find the present tense narration mechanical at times, and the story begins slowly, but this helps form an impression of the protagonist and her dull marking of days. Genuine humor and well-crafted characters make this a memorable and inspiring novel. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1988, he received a grant from the national Endowment of the Arts to document Boston&#39;s Central Artery/Tunnel Project.Gr 5-8-The "Big Dig" is the largest and most complex (and some might add, disruptive) U.S. transportation reconstruction project to date. Officially known as the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, the "dig" began in 1991, with an estimated 14 billion dollar price tag and a 20-year time frame, as an effort to solve Boston's massive traffic problems. Separate chapters are devoted to the four major elements of the project: the staged construction of tunnels, bridges and viaducts, aboveground highways, and surface roads and rights-of-way. These nuts-and-bolts descriptions are framed by an informative introduction with pertinent Boston history and a Central Artery timeline and a concluding essay on the relationship between urban infrastructure and quality of life. Vibrant, full-color photographs appear throughout and numerous maps and diagrams are carefully deployed to further enhance understanding of the text. A glossary of 15 construction terms highlighted in the text is somewhat superfluous. Vanderwarker succeeds in reducing a highly complex endeavor to comprehensible parts in a straightforward, lucid narrative. An impressive true-life tale of American ingenuity.<p></p><p><i>Mary Ann Carcich, Mattituck-Laurel Public Library, Mattituck, NY</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Prodigal Daughter (Davis Landing, Book 5) (Love Inspired #372)</h2><p><i>The Davis Landing Observer</i> Page 5<br>The Gossip Guru<br> hears Hamilton daughter Melissa, who'd disappeared not long after her father's first medical crisis, has finally come home&#x2014;pregnant!

Her snow-white hair was styled into old-fashioned waves, and she had a death grip on the side of the rickety folding ladder he stood on.</p> <p>"I'll be fine, Aunt Lettie, but maybe you should move away...just in case."</p> <p>She scurried to the other side of the camel back sofa with amazing speed for a woman her age.</p> <p>"If you fall, you're likely to lie on this floor until the cows come home 'cause there's no way I can be picking up a man your size."</p> <p>Richard replaced the burned-out light in the high ceiling fan and stepped down with a sigh of relief. He had lost a good twenty pounds after his doctor took him to task, but his six-foot-two-inch frame still carried plenty of muscle. The antique stepladder his great-aunt had pulled from the depths of her hall closet for the occasion had creaked and groaned, but held&#x2014;this time. He would see that she had it replaced with a sturdy new one before the next bulb died.</p> <p>"And the Lord said, "Let there be light," and there was. Thank you, my boy. That surely will help these old eyes to see the Good Book again."</p> <p>"My pleasure, Aunt Lettie. Is there anything else I can do while I'm here?" He resisted the urge to glance at his watch. He enjoyed Wednesday afternoons with Aunt Lettie, but each time he came to visit, she would find excuse after excuse to keep him from leaving. She was lonely, he understood that. More than once over the years, he had tried to convince her to move into a retirement home where she would have the company of folks her own age.</p> <p>Lettie stubbornly refused to budge from the apartment over the shop in downtown Hickory Mills, Tennessee, that had once belonged to her and her husband. Their furniture store had long since closed and the space downstairs had been sold and converted into a shoe store, but Lettie wouldn't budge from her home. She always said that she had lived here for seventy years and the only way she was leaving was in a pine box. When it came to stubbornness, the good Lord had broken the mold after He fashioned Lettie Corbet McNeil.</p> <p>Glancing around, Richard had to admit her home was cozy. The high, molded plaster ceilings made the place feel spacious while the tall arched windows with white lace curtains let in plenty of sunshine. Their gleaming panes were reflected in the polished surface of the cherrywood sideboard with its brass candlesticks and artful arrangement of old china plates and figurines. All of her antique furnishings shone with loving care, from the gilt-and-black-lacquer Regency writing desk in the corner to the massive oak pedestal dinning table with its ball-and-claw feet.</p> <p>His great-aunt was, he realized, very like the things she owned&#x2014;a beautifully preserved part of a bygone era.</p> <p>The tiny woman laid a hand on her cheek and tapped gently as she considered what needed repairs. "Let me see. The front door gets to squeaking something awful when the humidity is high."</p> <p>"I oiled it when I first came today."</p> <p>"Oh, that's right, you did. Well, I reckon that's all there is, but you don't have to run off, do you?"</p> <p>"I need to get back to the office."</p> <p>"Don't you work half days on Wednesday?"</p> <p>"Things have been a bit hectic lately. I have some paperwork to catch up on."</p> <p>"Your papa would be so proud to see you in that fancy place over in Davis Landing. You might have come from humble beginnings in Hickory Mills, but you've made your mark in the world. And that house of yours! My, my! It's big enough to hold a dozen young'uns."</p> <p>"It feels crowded these days."</p> <p>"How is your sister getting along? Such a sad thing, her house catching fire like that. "Twas a blessing from the Lord that no one got hurt."</p> <p>"Angela and Dave are doing okay. The girls are adjusting, but it's been hard on them. The renovations on their house should be done in another two months. I was glad to give them a place to stay, but I do miss my peace and quiet. Angela said to tell you that she and the girls will be over to visit on Saturday, as usual." He picked up his suit jacket from where it lay folded over the arm of the sofa and slipped it on.</p> <p>"I'll be glad for their company, that's for sure. I reckon having those two little girls living with you is making you wish you had a family of your own. It's long past time you settled down and got married. You're not getting any younger, you know."</p> <p>"I'm thirty-four. You make it sound like I've got one foot in the grave."</p> <p>She set her hands on her hips and leaned back to look up at him. "Like I said&#x2014;long past time."</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed her wrinkled cheek. "I'll get married when I find a girl who can bake a pecan pie as good as yours and not before."</p> <p>"Oh, go on! Flattery will get you nowhere."</p> <p>"I was hoping it would get me one more piece of pie."</p> <p>"You take the rest of it home with you for those girls. And mind you don't go eatin' more than your share on the way."</p> <p>Ten minutes later, Richard sat behind the wheel of his black Mercedes in downtown Hickory Mills and switched on his windshield wipers as drizzle began to fall from the leaden sky. If only he could have left Lettie's fifteen minutes earlier, he would have missed the jam of traffic that accompanied the local dock-workers getting off shift and the arrival of the afternoon bus. Visiting with Lettie was always a high point in his week, but he hated wasting time in traffic.</p> <p>As he waited impatiently behind two taxis loading baggage and passengers, he noticed the Collin's Drugstore across the street was for sale.</p> <p>The tall window cases were bare except for the redand-white For Sale sign taped to the glass. He had worked there as a stock boy through most of high school. Several other stores on the block had closed over the past few years and hadn't found new owners. Graffiti marred the cinder block wall beside the bus station and trash littered the alley. It was sad to see his old neighborhood going downhill.</p> <p>His cell phone rang and interrupted his musing. He pulled it from his pocket. His secretary's quiet voice claimed his attention.</p> <p>"Mr. Delaney is here to see you, sir."</p> <p>"Delaney? He doesn't have an appointment today."</p> <p>"I told him that, sir." Margaret Woodrow's voice dropped even lower. "He insists you said it would be all right to just drop by any old time and add a codicil to his will."</p> <p>Richard chuckled. "He probably wants to disinherit his ungrateful nephew again. Or is he adding him back? I can't remember&#x2014;he's changed it so many times. All right, Margaret. I'm still in Hickory Mills. I'll be there in about twenty minutes. If he can wait, I'll see him."</p> <p>He tucked his cell phone back in his pocket. The line of traffic hadn't moved, but at least the other lane was clear. He checked in his rearview mirror before pulling out and stopped short. Was that Melissa Hamilton leaving the bus station?</p> <p>Turning his head to get a better view, he saw that he was right. She walked past him to the street corner. There, she set down her black duffel bag and raised a hand to sweep her long blond hair back over her shoulder.</p> <p>She certainly was as lovely as ever. The overcast sky couldn't dim the taffy and honey brightness of her thick hair. It flowed in rippling waves almost to the center of her back. She was dressed in a flared skirt with big yellow sunflowers on a red background and a yellow blouse with short puff sleeves. Over her arms she had draped a red shawl with a yellow fringe. Pulling the flimsy shawl up to cover her shoulders, she shivered and turned her back to the wind. The late-October air definitely had a chill in it. As he watched her, the rain began in earnest. She glanced up, then lifted her shawl to cover her head.</p> <p>Richard frowned. What on earth was the daughter of Wallace Hamilton doing coming into town on the bus?</p> <p>Not that it mattered how she got here. The important thing was that she was home again. Wallace and Nora had both been worried sick about their youngest child. Melissa had left town with her boyfriend months ago and no one had heard from her since. That in itself was bad enough, but to disappear when her father was seriously ill seemed totally selfish. As the baby of the Hamilton family, she had always been overindulged and spoiled, but this time she had gone too far.</p> <p>Wallace's publishing firm, Hamilton Media, was one of Richard's most important clients, but more than that, Wallace and Nora were his friends. He knew what a strain Wallace's leukemia and bone marrow transplant had put on the man and his family. That Melissa had run off without a word hadn't set well with Richard and a lot of other people.</p> <p>He had always hoped the lovable but wayward girl would come around and grow up into a responsible adult like the rest of the Hamilton kids, but maybe he had been wrong about her.</p> <p>He watched as she tried to hail a cab, but the taxis in line already had fares. She looked around as if she didn't know what to do next. Suddenly, he was struck by how fragile and bewildered she looked.</p> <p>Vivacious and flirty was the way he would have described Melissa five months ago. She had always used her charm, including batting those big brown eyes at men, in order to get her way. Now, the woman shivering on the corner simply looked tired and lost.</p> <p>It only took him a moment to decide what to do next. It wasn't the first time he'd helped Melissa Hamilton out of a jam and it wasn't likely to be the last. He pulled out around the taxis and stopped at the corner in front of her. He pressed the electric button and the passenger-side window slid open. He leaned across the seat and called out. "Melissa, do you need a ride?"</p> <p>Melissa jumped, startled by the sound of someone calling her name. She clutched her shawl more tightly and leaned down to look in the car that had pulled up beside her. Her father's attorney sat behind the wheel of a shiny, black sedan.</p> <p>She had to admit that Richard McNeil looked decidedly handsome in his charcoal-gray tailored suit and white button-down dress shirt minus a tie. It had always amazed her how such a big man could wear his clothes so well. With his rugged good looks, black hair and fabulous bright blue eyes, it wasn't surprising that she had suffered a crush on him in her teenage years. Maybe she still harbored a trace of it, she thought, if she were being honest with herself.</p> <p>Of all the people who knew her family, why did Richard McNeil have to be the one to see her slinking back into town?</p> <p>"Mr. McNeil, what are you doing here?"</p> <p>"It looks like I'm offering you a lift."</p> <p>She hesitated, not sure what to do next. Glancing around, she saw that no empty taxi had appeared. Waiting for one would only prolong the inevitable encounter with her sister. She took a step toward the car.</p> <p>"I hate to be any trouble."</p> <p>"It's no trouble. I'm on my way back to my office, but I can drop you off at your home if you like."</p> <p>She bit her lip and hesitated, then said, "Could you drop me off at my sister Amy's instead?"</p> <p>"Sure thing. Hop in before you get any wetter." A flurry of raindrops accompanied his words.</p> <p>"All right. If you're sure it isn't any trouble." She picked up her bag, opened the door and slid into the front seat. Instantly, she was engulfed by the masculine scent of his aftershave, the smell of leather upholstery and the aroma of...was that pecan pie? Her stomach did a flip-flop.</p> <p>"I can put your bag in the trunk," he offered.</p> <p>"No, this is fine. Thank you." She wrapped her arms around her duffel and held it tightly in her lap, hoping to hide her pregnancy for a little while longer. At five months she wasn't showing much, but it wouldn't be long before even her full skirt and baggy peasant blouse wouldn't conceal how far Wallace Hamilton's youngest daughter had fallen.</p></p><h2>Boys Over Flowers, Vol. 24</h2><p>Born into a middle class family and considered poor compared to her wealthy classmates, typical teenager Tsukushi Makino deals with life, love, and new classmates after she is accepted into the prestigious Eitoku academy.</p><p></p><h2>Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year, 1974</h2><p><p>Take 139 leading editorial<br>cartoonists from the United States and Canada, inspire their creative talents<br>with the major political issues of 1973, and the result is this provocative<br>pictorial history of one of the Twentieth Century�s most tumultuous years.</p><p>This, the second volume of the<br>series, features the graphic commentary of virtually every major editorial<br>cartoonist working in North America today, including twelve Pulitzer Prize<br>winners.

In these essays and stories on such subjects as saving Joe DiMaggio&#x2019;s reputation from the clutches of an iconoclastic biographer, marveling at the skills of Michael Jordan, shaking free of an addiction to radio sports talk shows, or contemplating the changing nature of the games he grew up with and played as a boy, Epstein turns writing about sports into an art at once penetrating and highly amusing.</p><p>Joseph Epstein is the former editor of The American Scholar. For thirty years he taught English at Northwestern University. His essays, short stories, and reviews have appeared in many magazines, both in America and abroad, among them The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Commentary, and the LondonTimes Literary Supplement. He lives in Evanston, Illinois.The erudite and witty Epstein, former editor of The American Scholar, has from the time of his Chicago childhood been a devoted, habituated sports fan, although in a prolific career, this is his first book on the subject. There are long and short nonfiction pieces here and three related short stories. . . . [T]here is . . . a good deal of eloquence and insight. His opening piece on John R. Tunis, the author of children&#x2019;s sports books, is especially well done and will stir memories in several generations of mostly male readers. Essays on standout individual sports figures, sometimes in the context of reviews of others&#x2019; books, are also quite good. The emphasis is on the Windy City (Michael Jordan, Bob Love, the Cubs) and secondarily on Jewish athletes, including Hank Greenberg, but neither focus is a detriment. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Epstein includes three solid pieces of fiction set in Chicago in the middle of this collection, the best of which is simply titled "The Goldin Boys," a coming-of-age story told through the melancholy eyes of a physician whose best boyhood friends were popular twin athletes. Epstein&#x2019;s eulogy for the long-gone magazine Sport . . . is also worth a read. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Masters of the Games, Mr. Epstein's collection of sports-themed essays, memoir vignettes and short stories, shows a writerly approach to sports without the usual clich�s. This is not a book about playing catch across the generations. And the simplicity of Mr. Epstein's argument is winning. The essence of sport, he says, is 'the practice of craft at a very high order' married to 'the absence of fraudulence and fakery.' (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>Epstein is well-known, well-regarded and remarkably prolific, yet despite an affection for sports that dates back to his Chicago childhood, this is his first book on the subject. Consider it worth the wait. . . . His understanding of the nature of his fandom offers a reflection of our own sporting interests . . . [I]t&#x2019;s when Epstein personalizes that he&#x2019;s at his most engaging. Stories about his boyhood predilection for sports and his self-recognized desire for style as opposed to substance on the playing field paint a wonderful portrait of the youthful sports fan of an era bygone. . . . [H]e&#x2019;s phenomenal when he offers his thoughts on the inherent irrationality of being a sports fan &#x2013; particularly as the times have changed. . . . Put it all together and it makes for a remarkable collection of one man&#x2019;s legacy of fandom. . . . Masters of the Games is a book that will draw in the sports fan, with an understanding of the highs and lows that come with loving a game or a team.

The door immediately swings shut on his chest, so he pushes it with his knee and edges through it sideways, left side first. One hundred percent of his attention is focused on not letting the door close on the can in his right hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means that when he steps onto the wet sidewalk with his back to the road, he&#x2019;s too preoccupied to hear the people running. So he&#x2019;s unprepared when the crowd suddenly floods past, going at top speed, and the very large man strikes him from behind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty pitches forward at a diagonal and bounces off a couple of running men on the way down. He instinctively throws his hands in front of him to break his fall, then tries to yank them back again when he registers the dangling paint cans. He fails on all counts, landing on his elbows with bone-chipping force and allowing the cans to hit the pavement hard enough to burst open in two eruptions of color, Apricot Cream (Rose&#x2019;s choice) and a sort of rotted eggplant called Urban Decay, which Miaow picked for her room.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who ran into him has come down on top of him, all the way to the pavement. Rafferty is trying to struggle out from under, his hands slipping on the apricot pavement, when he hears three sounds, like the crack of a bat in a stadium, and the man shudders as though he&#x2019;s been shocked, then shudders again and rolls off Rafferty and into the paint, on his side.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;His blue eyes, wide with surprise, look at Rafferty as though Rafferty is the most important question he&#x2019;s ever been asked and he doesn&#x2019;t know the answer.<br>Rafferty pulls his head back for a better look, and the man opens his mouth, but all that comes out is a ragged tatter of air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#x2019;s a once-tough sixty-five or so, the planes of his face softened by the passage of years, wearing a T-shirt and a photographer&#x2019;s vest over cargo shorts, both soaked from the rain. The chunky garments emphasize the thirty or thirty-five extra pounds that suggest he might be American or German. His fair, wet hair, vaguely military and brush-cut, all of an inch long, is in retreat from a high, balding forehead. For some reason what draws Rafferty&#x2019;s attention, as people continue to run past, is that the skin on the top of the man&#x2019;s head is crimson from sunburn. It&#x2019;s been raining for days, but the man is sunburned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty glances up the sloping road, sees that the running crowd is thinning, and says to the staring man, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to get up. Are you okay?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As he pulls himself to a sitting position, the wide eyes follow him and the mouth opens and closes noiselessly again. Then the man reaches up with his right hand and it lands heavily on the pocket of Rafferty&#x2019;s T-shirt, tearing it slightly before the hand rises again and comes down on Rafferty&#x2019;s left shoulder. The weight of it tugs Rafferty down a few inches, and the gesture opens the man&#x2019;s vest. Up close, Rafferty sees the blackish red, like a third paint pigment, saturating the white T-shirt beneath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Hold it,&#x201d; Rafferty says to no one. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The bat cracks again, and it looks as if the man has been yanked by an invisible cord, jerked three or four inches, headfirst, over the slick, colorful pavement. His head slowly turns to the right, with so much effort that Rafferty wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to hear it creak, and he stares disbelievingly in the direction the running crowd came from.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The red pools into the apricot under the man&#x2019;s chest.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Let me get you up,&#x201d; Rafferty says. All he can think is that the bleeding might slow if the man is upright instead of facing downhill. Rafferty slips an arm under the bleeding man&#x2019;s shoulders and slowly, carefully, pulls him to a sitting position. The man&#x2019;s head wobbles and then lolls left and drops forward, his chin hitting his chest so hard that Rafferty can hear his teeth snap together.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty is looking wildly for help when the man suddenly raises his head and says something, almost a whisper.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Rafferty says. &#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The man&#x2019;s mouth works two or three times, like someone getting ready to pronounce an unfamiliar sound, and he coughs a thick, dark, oyster-size gout of blood down over his chin. The muscles in his face stiffen into a mask, rigid with will. He peels his upper lip free of his teeth and says, in a voice that&#x2019;s almost all air, &#x201c;Helen.&#x201d; With a tiny nod, he brings his head back up. &#x201c;Eckersley.&#x201d; Another cough, more blood. &#x201c;Cheyenne,&#x201d; he says, and he slumps to his left.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty bends over him, looking for a breath, feeling for a pulse, and the gray day is shoved aside by a burst of light. He looks up to see a television crew&#x2014;a cameraman with a shoulder-mounted rig, a lighting man with a blinding sun gun, and a third guy, probably the producer, pushing the other two into position. Rafferty&#x2019;s shouting &#x201c;Get a doctor!&#x201d; but the crew comes in closer, closer, the cameraman going into a gradual crouch to catch the dying man&#x2019;s face, and Rafferty reaches behind him with his free hand, snags the wire handle of one of the mostly-empty cans of paint, and slings it at the camera.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The can clatters on the camera&#x2019;s grip, sending its remaining paint in an airborne arc of Urban Decay, and the cameraman rocks onto his seat, yanking the camera back and throwing out a hand to catch himself. The producer advances on Rafferty, shouting, but then three brown-uniformed police materialize between them. One of them slams his chest into the producer, backing him off, and the other two come over to Rafferty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; one of the cops asks. His English is heavily accented.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, sure,&#x201d; Rafferty says in Thai, &#x201c;but this man&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Rafferty can finish the sentence, though, a new man, wearing an elegant raincoat over street clothes, steps in between him and the man lying flat on the pavement. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take care of him,&#x201d; the man in the raincoat says in English. &#x201c;You just go with the officers.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got him,&#x201d; the man says, leaning close and holding Rafferty&#x2019;s gaze. He&#x2019;s tall for a Thai, sleek and handsome, if a little puffy beneath the eyes, and his English is as accent-free as California. &#x201c;Either go with the officers willingly or they&#x2019;ll drag you.&#x201d; He kneels in front of the man wearing the photographer&#x2019;s vest, blocking Rafferty&#x2019;s view.<br>One of the uniforms bends down and extends a hand. The other has his hip cocked and his hand resting on the butt of his pistol.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty gets up, avoiding the outstretched hand. The patrolman closer to him wraps his fingers around Rafferty&#x2019;s bicep and tugs him away. And then there are three more cops coming down the street, eyeing the TV crew. The producer helps his cameraman up, whispers something to him, and hauls the lighting man toward the cops. Instantly the cameraman is sprinting down the hill, his feet splashing in the gutter, as the producer and the lighting guy dance interference in front of the oncoming police. By the time one of the cops shakes free and takes off in pursuit, the cameraman has rounded the corner at the bottom of the hill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The uniforms manhandle Rafferty downhill and position him in a doorway, out of the rain, so the fallen man and the other police are behind him. The street is empty now, except for the knot of men in front of the paint shop. Rafferty tries to turn to look behind him, but the cop pulls him back into position and says, &#x201c;Papers.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;That man&#x2019;s been shot,&#x201d; Rafferty says, the realization dawning on him at last. &#x201c;He needs a doctor.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Nobody got shot.&#x201d; The cops exchange a fast glance, and the one who&#x2019;s not holding Rafferty lets his eyes flick up the hill. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; his partner says.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I heard the gun,&#x201d; Rafferty says. &#x201c;He was bleeding like&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t shot,&#x201d; the cop says. &#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t any gun.&#x201d; He gives Rafferty&#x2019;s arm a token shake. &#x201c;Let me see your papers.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty says, &#x201c;Oh, for Christ&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; but he digs in the rear pockets of his jeans and pries his wallet out. As he begins to open it, he sees the smear of blood on his hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he says, holding it under the nose of the nearer cop. &#x201c;He was bleeding. Don&#x2019;t tell me he wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Nosebleed,&#x201d; the cop says. &#x201c;Papers,&nbsp;<i>now.</i>&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty wipes the blood on the thigh of his jeans and fishes through the wallet until he comes up with two tissue-soft sheets of paper, almost transparent with wear. He opens one and then the other. &#x201c;Passport. Current visa.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Where are the originals?&#x201d; the nearer cop says. He&#x2019;s meaningfully lean, the kind of thin that rarely signals an easy nature, and his lips are as sharp as a parrot&#x2019;s beak. His partner, younger and fleshier, seems to be fixated on what&#x2019;s happening up the hill, his mouth half open.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;At my apartment.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Philip Rafferty,&#x201d; the cop reads aloud, mangling both names. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a resident of Thailand?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what the visa says.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cop gives him small, tight eyes, as though he&#x2019;s already sighting a weapon. &#x201c;I ask you questions,&#x201d; he says in English. &#x201c;You answer, you understand?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, I think I can follow that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you carry originals?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Because someone might take them, some cop or someone, and I&#x2019;d have to get new ones.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cop says, &#x201c;Puh,&#x201d; just barely not a spit. He holds out the copies and, as Rafferty reaches for them, drops them. They flutter to the wet pavement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;For a few seconds, Rafferty looks into the cop&#x2019;s eyes. What he sees there makes him nod and bend down to pick up the papers.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cop puts his foot on them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Rafferty says, straightening. He can hear the blood in his ears. &#x201c;Fuck them, I can make new ones.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The cop moves his foot. The papers are translucent with water and smeared with mud. &#x201c;Pick up,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;If you not, if you walk away, I stop you and say I want papers, then arrest you because you don&#x2019;t have.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty leans against the wall, feeling the pulse thrum at the side of his neck. &#x201c;Back up,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Until you back up, I&#x2019;ll stand here and we&#x2019;ll look at each other.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft-faced cop tells his partner, in Thai, to stop fooling around. After a moment the lean cop backs away and then makes a gesture, palm up, in the direction of the documents.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty bends and peels the papers free of the sidewalk, but as he straightens, the lean cop steps closer again, and his fingers dart into the pocket of Rafferty&#x2019;s T-shirt. When they come out, they&#x2019;re holding a yellow slip of paper, tightly folded. He opens it to reveal a small diamond shape, cut into the center by someone who&#x2019;s folded it into quarters and then snipped off the tip of the central fold. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my yellow piece of paper,&#x201d; Rafferty says. He&#x2019;s never seen it before.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What does it say?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;The rules by which I live,&#x201d; Rafferty says. &#x201c;The Diamond Sutra.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The other cop looks over his partner&#x2019;s shoulder and laughs. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your laundry ticket,&#x201d; he says.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in code.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The plump cop laughs again, and even the lean one relaxes a little. He hands the ticket back, saying, &#x201c;You going to need the clean clothes. You all dirty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Thanks. I hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The lean cop backs away. &#x201c;You go now. Go home.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I need to buy some more paint.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Home. Cannot go in store now.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty turns to look uphill again, and the plump cop stands in his way, although &nbsp;&nbsp;Rafferty gets a quick glimpse of a tight knot of uniforms and plainclothes around the fallen&nbsp;<i>farang.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Go,&#x201d; the plump cop says. &#x201c;Go now or we arrest you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got an apartment to paint,&#x201d; Rafferty says, pocketing the yellow ticket.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Have too much paint in Bangkok,&#x201d; says the plump cop. &#x201c;Can buy anywhere. You go.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I go,&#x201d; Rafferty says, sidestepping the lean cop and plodding downhill. A siren emits a short, throat-clearing whoop behind him, and he turns to see an ambulance glide into position in front of the paint store. The lean cop waves him on:&nbsp;<i>Keep going.</i>&nbsp;<br>At the foot of the mild little hill is a good-size four-lane boulevard, and Rafferty is surprised to see the wet pavement shining in a flat, uninterrupted slab, as empty as outer space. A block to his right, he sees a barrier: white sawhorses set up on the far side of the turn that leads up to the hill with the paint shop on it. Half a dozen policemen wearing yellow slickers have assumed poses of varying vigilance, facing the oncoming traffic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning around, Rafferty sees a mirror version of the blockade two blocks in the other direction. Since there&#x2019;s no traffic on the street he&#x2019;s just hiked down, it&#x2019;s not a difficult guess that it&#x2019;s been barricaded, too, a few blocks away in both directions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels strange to him; Bangkok is many things, but it&#x2019;s never empty. As he walks, he sees the wide blue eyes and feels again the sudden jerk of the body atop his when the first bullet struck it. Feels retroactively an unbidden thrill at having been missed. Whoever was shooting was either very good or completely indifferent.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The man's odd haircut, the haircut of someone who might not have been able to let go of being military. When Rafferty was growing up in the desert outside Lancaster, California, he had met men like that, friends of his father, men who had gone into service at eighteen, probably leaving behind a teenager they no longer wanted to be, and then spent three or four decades having everything decided for them. Men who, at the age of fifty, had never given a thought to how they should comb their hair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;But if one of those men had been killed, he thinks as he makes his way down the center of the wet, deserted boulevard, there might have been a cop or two, maybe an ambulance. Not half a dozen policemen, barricades, plainclothes guys, multiple ambulances, and&#x2014;he remembers the handsome one with the puffy eyes&#x2014;spooks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely spooks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the rain, his clothes are stiffening with the paint, his entire front and left side a patchwork of apricot with artistic mottlings of Urban Decay. Looking down at it now, in the even gray light, he decides the apricot is too strong for the living room. It needs more white.<br>&nbsp; Spooks.</p><h2>This Is the Gospel: A Kids Read Truth Story &amp; Scripture Book</h2><p>This Is the Gospel presents the story of God&#39;s love for us.

His twelve-year-old perfect sister, Lexi, wants a cat. Their mother, who works very long hours as a nurse, wants neither. Pets are expensive so who's going to pay for everything? And what happens to the pet when the siblings are at their dad's for the weekend?<br> Otto has an idea. What if he got a job and earned enough money to pay for the dog? Then Lexi has to open her big mouth. She proposes that whichever sibling can raise enough money first will decide which pet they get. Oddly enough, their mom and dad agree.<br> With Otto and Lexi each out to defeat the other, their business plans become more elaborate and involved. As the competition gets fiercer, the stakes get higher, and the battle lines have been drawn, so let the Pet War begin. . . .<br></p><p>Allan Woodrow grew up in Michigan, always wanting to be an author. But his teachers told him to write about what he knew, and he discovered he didn&#x2019;t know very much. It turns out he didn&#x2019;t know very much for quite a long time. Allan isn&#x2019;t sure he really knows anything more now than he did in third grade, but he got tired of waiting and decided to start writing anyway. Allan currently lives near Chicago with his family and two vicious goldfish.Siblings Otto and Lexi want a pet, but that is as far as their agreement on anything goes. Otto wants a dog, and Lexi wants a cat. Their mother is not sure either of them&#x2014;especially Otto&#x2014;is ready for pet ownership, but after impassioned pleas from both, she agrees to let them compete to decide if it will be a dog or a cat as the family pet. Each has a month to raise $500; at the end of the month, whoever has collected the money gets to make the decision. If they get into trouble or let their grades slip, then they will be disqualified. Lexi, a straight-A student, sets up a tutoring business and then a sign-making business. Otto, after several disastrous attempts, starts a dog-walking business. He tries to be responsible, but his nature does not make it easy. Who will win? Although narrated by Otto, Woodrow&#x2019;s humorous novel has both boy and girl reader appeal.

He infiltrated the Civil Rights movement, met with militant Muslims in Harlem, and was sent abroad to kill enemies of the American state, even as his game shows began to soar to ratings success.

Beginning with explanations of Sun signs, Moon signs, Ascendent, Midheaven, planets and their positions in various houses, this book leads on to show how to make a personal chart in easy-to-follow, step-by-step sequences. The encyclopaedia is aimed at novice and experienced astrologers alike.</p><p>With its lavish color illustrations, detailed discussions of astrological techniques, and comprehensive chart building tools, <i>Parkers' Astrology</i> is an outstanding book for any serious student of astrology. The husband and wife team of Julia and Derek Parker reissued this edition that offers many new components, such as the recently discovered comet/asteroid Chiron and its eccentric orbit. (For example, when Chiron is in Aries, the typical Arian could experience considerable restlessness.) It also includes new discussions on eclipses, Relocation Astrology, and Horary Astrology (which focuses on where and when a question is asked, rather than a birth chart). The first half offers rich color graphics and compelling narratives about the 12 sun signs, various chart reading techniques, and how astrology influences sexuality, health, business, and family. The second half delves into the nitty-gritty work of astrology and is downscaled to three-color visuals. It includes a hefty 150- page section on "The Planets at Work" and a 75-page section on astrological tables. The 1994 edition was faulted for being too difficult to build a chart from. Hopefully, astrologers will find this revised edition more accessible and consistent. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Julia and Derek Parker are a best-selling husband and wife team who have produced over 50 books, including the internationally acclaimed The Complete Astrologer and The Complete Book of Dreams.

In the case of Emma O'Brea, the delusions concern her marriage: When her husband Charlie disappears it quickly becomes apparent that Emma was the only person in Canada who didn't recognize how desperate he had been to leave. And then there's Eddie Addison, an overgrown delivery boy, far from the sharpest knife in the drawer, and obsessed &#x2013; dangerously obsessed &#x2013; with a pretty young student. Eddie and Emma would seem to have little in common, but when Inspector Karl Alberg is called in to solve the riddle of Charlie's vanishing act, the two sets of disturbing delusions begin to converge, with a climax that even the canniest reader is unlikely to see coming.</p><p>L.R.

He wrote 28 novels, several of which were made into films, as well as plays and non-fiction. Australian-born, his books have sold nearly 70 million copies worldwide, and have been translated into 28 languages. He is best known for his novels The Devil&#39;s Advocate, The Shoes of the Fisherman and The Clowns of God.Killing time before starting his civilian life, an Aussie sailor signs on with the crew of an American yacht and promptly falls in love with the owner's gorgeous, young fianc&#x201a;e--in a clever romance by a master entertainer. The Second World War has been over for seven years, but big, handsome Bryan Cavanaugh, late of His Majesty's Australian Navy, is still trying to figure out what to do with his life. He's gotten his law degree, but hanging out his shingle in Melbourne holds no appeal. Does he want Europe? The US? To support himself and his dithering, Bryan, a skilled shiphandler, has been bumming around the Med, doing whatever people will hire him to do. American millionaire Declan Molloy hires him to crew his grand new yacht, the Salamandra d'Oro. Molloy's a brooding, two-fisted rich guy who's decided to settle down long enough to marry into one of Europe's most distinguished families, the Farnesi of Italy and the Vatican. His fianc&#x201a;e, selected with the help of the Pope's closest advisors, is the astonishingly beautiful, thoroughly spoiled, and shockingly young Giulia Farnesi. The middle-class Cavanaugh finds himself in uncharted waters. Molloy's crew also includes a resourceful Cunard stewardess to relieve his sexual needs (since Giulia must remain a virgin), a couple of male American dancers, a philosophizing cook, and Molloy's lifelong Greco-American chum, who is rather more than chum. In addition to his relationship with the See of Rome, Molloy does business with the CIA--business that lands his dear friend in the hospital and puts young Bryan, badly smitten with Giulia, into the number one spot on the crew. When Molloy flies off to Naples to be with his battered pal, Giulia, Bryan, and Molloy's aristocratic guests have time to get into all sorts of interesting trouble. Very charming.

Each title includes a themed introduction by leading authorities on the subject, life-and-times chronology of the author, text summaries, annotated reading lists and selected criticism and notes.</p><p>The reputation of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (1914-1953) as one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century has not waned in the fifty years since his death. His work, noted for its lush metaphors, musicality, and playfulness within traditional forms, was largely responsible for modernizing poetic verse. Thomas also wrote captivating short stories, a novella, several screenplays and radio plays, as well as his delightful stage play, Under Milk Wood&#x2015;all infused with his passion for the English language and his enduring love of Wales.Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who completed Under Milk Wood, his poetic &#34;play for voices,&#34; just weeks before he died in 1953, appeared in only one recorded version of that acclaimed work. Here it is, captured by chance when someone placed a tape recorder on the stage for this live performance. Thomas serves as narrator/commentator of this tale of a day in the lives of 53 characters in a small Welsh village; his is a compelling, booming, lyrical voice. His five excellent companion readers, all of them, interestingly, American, match his deftness in what is a somewhat plotless but highly entertaining and touching account of simple people dealing with the complexities of existence. Top marks for this cassette--and thanks to the long-forgotten audiophile who thought to tape the drama. T.H.

Before this, church registers have the only reference to an ancestor's birth, marriage or death, but because of the destruction of many Church of Ireland burial records, and the late beginning dates of many Roman Catholic and Presbyterian burial registers, a gravestone inscription may be the only record of an ancestor's death. <p>In this book every church and burial ground in Ireland is identified in relation to a townland or street address. Each townland is located in its appropriate civil parish, and each parish is listed in alphabetical order in its county and is preceded by a number which gives its location in A New Genealogical Atlas of Ireland. An Ordnance Survey number lets the researcher pinpoint the church's exact location on a six-inch Ordnance Survey map. Churches that are now defunct and graveyards that have been separated from their churches can be located with this guide.</p></p><p></p><h2>Wild Knitting</h2><p>Introducing knitting wilder than your wildest dreams!

It is simultaneously an ethnographic inquiry into the nature of art, an introduction to modern Turkey, and a model study of folk art, combining the theories of folklore, anthropology, cultural geography, and art history. Describing his research in the cities, towns, and mountain villages, Glassie ranges widely across media. He tells of architecture, calligraphy, woodworking, and earthenware, but lays particular emphasis on the brilliant, underglaze-painted ceramics of Kutahya and the rich, piled carpets for which Turkey has been famed for centuries. While searching for the traits that define art and the stylistic complexities that characterize Turkish creativity, Glassie focuses on the artists and their theories and practices as well as the works they produce.

During the 5th through 9th centuries, Frankish society transformed from a relatively primitive tribal structure to a more complex hierarchical organization. Suzanne Fonay Wemple sets out to understand the forces at work in expanding and limiting women's sphere of activity and influence during this time. Her goal is to explain the gap between the ideals and laws on one hand and the social reality on the other. What effect did the administrative structures and social stratification in Merovingian society have on equality between the sexes? Did the emergence of the nuclear family and enforcement of monogamy in the Carolingian era enhance or erode the power and status of women?</p><p>Wemple examines a wealth of primary sources, such deeds, testaments, <i>formulae</i>, genealogy, ecclesiastical and secular court records, letters, treatises, and poems in order to reveal the enduring German, Roman, and Christian cultural legacies in the Carolingian Empire.

The main story is a "he said, she said" affair between Stephan Mitchell, a well-to-do young software designer who's determined not to let any one woman get in the way of his good time, and Chant� Marie Ellis, who's decided to start turning the tables on men who try to play her for a fool. From now on, she declares, "A dog gets what a dog gets... <i>dogged</i>." Dickey makes their road to romance extremely rocky; in addition to sorting out their own feelings for each other, both Stephan and Chant� have to contend with exes who have just gotten out of their lives. Meanwhile, Stephan's best friend, Darnell, is having problems with his marriage: he wants to be a writer, but his wife insists that he put aside the "hobby" to pay more attention to her. When he meets Chant�'s friend Tammy, an up-and-coming actress-singer who not only understands Darnell's artistic passion but encourages him, his commitment to marital fidelity is pushed to the limit. <p> As always, Dickey shows that he's on top of the current scene, peppering his characters' lives with the latest in black fashion and culture (if you ever find yourself driving in the Los Angeles area, you'll know exactly what your radio presets should be). Although the ending might be a little too neatly wrapped up, you'll never know before you get there whether the next chapter's going to contain romance, comedy, heartache--or maybe a little of each.

On the recording, the stories stand on their own. For background about the tales, and about Shakespeare and circumstances at the time of his writing, one has to read the accompanying book. Patrick Ryan flavors each story with distinctive elements--the arrogance of a conniving water pixie who meets his match in "The Devil's Bet," the remorse of a father who has missed years of his daughter's life in "Cap o' Rushes," and the wiliness of a disguised lawyer in "A Bargain Is a Bargain."

In this book, she sheds new light on her relationship with John, providing a revealing portrait of one of the most iconic figures in music.</p><p>This isn't Cynthia Lennon's first book about her legendary ex-husband. <i>A Twist of Lennon</i>--a slim volume that John tried to suppress on grounds of libel--came out in 1978. But now, 25 years after his death, she finally feels ready to tell the "full and truthful story" of their life together. Why? In his foreword, son Julian writes of their being "dismissed or at best treated as insignificant bit players" in the story of John's life; it's Cynthia's goal, with <i>John</i>, to set the record straight. She does make a case for being more than just "the impressionable young girl who fell for him, then trapped him into marriage," and it's moving to read, in his own words, of John's love for his son. And while there's nothing new in her account of the Fab Four's rise to fame, as the greatest success story of the rock era, it's a legend that bears retelling. But most salient of all are Cynthia's sketches of pain, regret, and intimidation. John was indeed a brilliant, loving man, but he was also "passionately jealous," "verbally cutting," sometimes abusive, and often neglectful. (It is hinted that his behavior may have paralleled that of the woman who raised him, his Aunt Mimi.) Unfortunately, Cynthia's "response to John's provocative and cruel behavior was to stick by him more solidly than ever...[feeling] that if he could trust me and believe that I loved him he might soften."<p></p>It's not this dysfunction, however, but rather John's use of LSD, on which she blames the emotional "chasm" that led to the failure of their marriage. And though the Lennons' divorce comes relatively late in the book, the pages that follow are by far the saddest, as they chronicle John's increasing distance from and neglect of his former family--especially Julian, who would only see his father three times after he moved to New York in 1971. It's no surprise that Cynthia lays much of the blame for this at the feet of Yoko Ono, who is described as controlling and insensitive, especially in the wake of John's murder. But even though there's a lot of bitterness and resentment in these pages, it's not overwhelming, being offset by Cynthia's fierce love for her son and her continuing affection for her ex-husband. A full picture of John Lennon's life will never exist as long as Ono judges herself unable to write about their time together, but <i>John</i> goes a long way toward improving the situation. <i>--Benjamin Lukoff</i>Cynthia Lennon was born in Blackpool in 1939 and brought up in Liverpool. She went to Liverpool&#39;s Junior Art School and graduated to Liverpool College of Art in 1957. There she met John Lennon, whose rebellious style, caustic wit and passion for rock and roll already marked him out. In their second year at college John and Cynthia fell in love. They married in 1962 and in 1963 their son, Julian was born. The Lennons moved to London in 1963 and then to Surrey, where they lived during the years of Beatles fame. In 1968 their marriage broke down and they were divorced in 1969. Julian remained with Cynthia, but saw John in London and later in New York, where he moved with his second wife, Yoko Ono. Cynthia now lives with her husband Noel Charles.</p><h2>The Collected Stories</h2><p>Signed by the author, 1st printing, A very good clean copy, in v. good DJ.</p><p>John McGahern was the author of five highly acclaimed novels and four collections of short stories. His novel <b>Amongst Women</b><i> </i>won the GPA Book Award and the Irish Times Award, was short-listed for the Booker Prize, and was made into a four-part BBC television series. He had been a visiting professor at Colgate University and at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, and was the recipient of the Society of Authors&#x2019; Award, the American-Irish Award, and the Prix �trang�re Ecureuil, among other awards and honors. His work appeared in anthologies and was translated into many languages. He died in 2006.McGahern is best known for his grim novels of Irish life, and readers of The Barracks, The Leavetaking and The Pornographer will immediately recognize his deft handiwork in these 35 stories. Operating fully within his country's vaunted short-story tradition (Frank O'Connor, Mary Lavin, et al.), McGahern meticulously builds prolonged moments of stasis, wherein accumulations of character and detail do not advance a story as much as deepen its roots. In the extraordinary "Swallows," the stultifying Irish country life is brightened for a moment by a Dublin traveler who plays Paganini on a Stradivarius, only to find his hosts asking for a bit of "Danny Boy." "Doorways," a tale of unrequited love, is formally and thematically framed by the presence of Beckettian vagabonds who offer wry but silent commentary. Although McGahern returns again and again to the same themes--emotional repression, poverty of mind and spirit, the ever-salubrious effects of stout and whiskey--he does so with an impressive and sometimes surprising range of characters (a gay fondler in "Lavin," a vulnerable translator of Chekhov and Mayakovsky in "The Beginning of an Idea"). In the end, what distinguishes McGahern's work is not his cold assessment of life in Ireland, but his ability to fan dying embers into temporary glow. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Savage Intrigue</h2><p>When her father, a white doctor known for treating Native Americans, is murdered, Sheleen is rescued by Chief Midnight Wolf and finds solace in his peaceful, hidden village and safety in his arms, until two very determined men track her down.

[This is] a richly complicated book which has the great virtue of almost everything Sir Laurens has written: it is impossible to put down. One can quite easily read it as an adventure/travel story, another glimpse into a most extraordinary life, ignoring the various themes which the author cleverly weaves into a philosophical argument. But nobody , I should imaging, will put down the book without feeling himself - however incorrectly - a wiser man ... There is nobody alive in whose company I would sooner spend five hours.&#34; Auberton Waugh, The Sunday Telegraph, Britain.</p><p>&#x201c; <i>Yet Being Someone Other</i> is undoubtedly the most unusual and unplaceable of all the dozen or more books Sir Laurens has written. Like most of them it is heavily autobiographical; but as one would expect from Sir Laurens, it is also much more than that - a kind of prolonged meditation on the part played in his life and that of the post-Renaissance modern world by ships and the sea.&#x201d; &#x2013; Christopher Booker, <i>The Times</i>The most revealing book that Laurens van der Post wrote about his extraordinary and eventful life; it is a distillation of the experiences that have moved him at the deepest level of the imagination and made him the exceptional person and writer he was. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Dagger-Star (Epic of Palins, Book 1)</h2><p>After captivating readers with her Chronicles of the Warlands trilogy, Elizabeth Vaughan now returns to that world with a beguiling tale of daggers and destiny, a cold and beautiful mercenary known as Red Gloves, and Josiah, a lone fighter emerging from the torched fields and razed farms of his homeland.

Madame Guyon reveals this as the relationship of the believer to the Lord, and opens new vistas for understanding the Lord&#39;s ways in bringing the believer to love Him.</p><p>The greatest love story ever written, the Song of Songs describes the emotional, unfolding story of the Bridegroom and His bride. Jeanne Guyon shows how the song of a young maiden, fervently in love with her suitor, becomes a powerful allegory of every believer&#39;s relationship with Christ depicted in the Song of Songs. Without any embarrassment for King Solomon&#39;s intimate portrayal of the lovers, she explores: The greatness of God&#39;s loveFinding God&#39;s favor in your lifeLearning to rest in His presenceHow trials can become blessingsTrue surrender to God&#39;s will in your lifeAllow your heart to draw near to the heart of God on this journey to the Father&#39;s love<b>Jeanne Guyon</b> (1648&#x2013;1717) was a Christian contemplative and writer. Being contemplative refers to what is sacredly obscure or secret, something that is remote from human comprehension. It reflects the search for a deeper spiritual life, for fellowship and oneness with the omniscient, omnipotent God who is also our Father.<br> Guyon wrote from the depth of her own spiritual experiences. Growing up in France during the decadent times of Louis XIV, she was devout at an early age, but was then caught up in the worldliness around her. After an arranged marriage at age fifteen, she became increasingly interested in spiritual things; and, for the rest of her life, she continued to seek God diligently, teach others, and write books on Christian devotion. These books have become Christian classics.<br> Guyon paid a heavy price for her views and her writings. Throughout her life, she underwent various trials, including persecution and imprisonment for her beliefs. Her commentary on Song of Songs was used to sentence her to prison.</p><h2>The &#34; Needlecraft&#34; Magazine Book of Needlepoint Stitches: A Step-by-step Stitching Guide</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

All of them work in Graterford's chapel, a place that is at once a sanctuary for religious contemplation and an arena for disputing the workings of God and man. Day in, day out, everything is, in its twisted way, rather ordinary. And then one of them disappears. </p><p><i>Down in the Chapel </i>tells the story of one week at Graterford Prison. We learn how the men at Graterford pass their time, care for themselves, and commune with their makers. We observe a variety of Muslims, Protestants, Catholics, and others, at prayer and in study and song. And we listen in as an interloping scholar of religion tries to make sense of it all. </p><p>When prisoners turn to God, they are often scorned as con artists who fake their piety, or pitied as wretches who cling to faith because faith is all they have left. Joshua Dubler goes beyond these stereotypes to show the religious life of a prison in all its complexity. One part prison procedural, one part philosophical investigation, <i>Down in the Chapel </i>explores the many uses prisoners make of their religions and weighs the circumstances that make these uses possible. Gritty and visceral, meditative and searching, it is an essential study of American religion in the age of mass incarceration.</p></p><p><p><b>Joshua Dubler</b> is an assistant professor of religion at the University of Rochester and the coauthor of <i>Bang! Thud: World Spirit from a Texas School Book Depository</i>. He has also taught at Haverford College, Columbia University, and Villanova University's program at Graterford Prison.</p>MONDAY <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Graterford Prison is in Pennsylvania&#x2019;s Montgomery County, thirty snaking miles northwest of Philadelphia&#x2019;s city line. The prison sits on a bucolic plateau of 1,700 acres that rises above the Perkiomen Creek. Fallow farmland runs uphill away from the creek, where, seasonally, deer and Canada geese lounge unmolested. At the top of the rise beside a small reservoir is the OSU, the Outside Service Unit, which houses the &#x201c;grays,&#x201d; who are misconduct free and creeping up on their minimums. Past the parking lots is the prison itself, sixty-two acres enclosed behind a thirty-foot-high nine-sided wall. Atop the wall, armed sentries man turrets from which, on a sunny afternoon, they can watch the grays play handball against the outside of the wall. Past the creek and across the valley, one sees the billowing silos of the Limerick nuclear power plant. To the south, the big-box stores inch closer by the year, but even from atop the wall, there is, I imagine, little evidence of that. <br>Though barely, it is still country here. On a summer evening, at leaving time, when the baseball game waiting for me in the car will be in the fourth or fifth and the cobalt heavens bleed to orange over the valley, this place is not unbeautiful. But in winter, when the wind pushes up from the valley, driving rain and snow sideways into the worn concrete of the wall&#x2019;s outer shell, the prison feels suddenly like a refuge and the world outside apathetic and grim, a place for coyotes and bears, but not remotely suited for men. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Declared &#x201c;state of the art&#x201d; when it opened in 1931, Graterford is by now a relic of an era gone by: clunky, decrepit, and unconducive to orderliness.1 Five two-tiered cellblocks, each of which houses 500 men, feed into a central corridor that runs from the front gate to the heart of the prison.2 To the right, past the hospital and the &#x201c;new side&#x201d; dorms, come the shop floors, the auditorium, the school wing, and the field house. At the corridor&#x2019;s terminus lies the chapel. <br>With its fluorescent light, yellow brick walls, crushed stone floor, and acrid odor, the main corridor could well be the hallway of my high school were it not pushing a quarter of a mile long&#x2014;a span broken by locked gates manned by uniformed guards with whom I exchange good-mornings as I pass. Past the security bubble at the second gate, I step to the right to avoid a correctional officer leading a train of fifty orange-clad &#x201c;jumpsuits,&#x201d; the system&#x2019;s new processees. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got two words for you: job security,&#x201d; the CO says to the gatekeeper. <br>&#x201c; <i>Chugga-chugga chugga-chugga</i>,&#x201d; chants the CO at the caboose. <br>The COs couldn&#x2019;t care less if I heard them, and I don&#x2019;t flatter myself by pretending otherwise. Absent the slate-colored band on the ID clipped to my lapel, there&#x2019;s no telling me from any of the jail&#x2019;s other civilian-clothed employees, whether administrator, counselor, support staff, or vendor. Nor am I on edge. Come and go a few times and Graterford is not a hard place to feel invisible. Presuming, that is, that you&#x2019;re not a woman. <br>With movements already over, the odd burgundy-clad prisoner scurries this way or that, a bit late to work, to the hospital, to counseling, to someplace else. &#x201c;Browns&#x201d; is what, for the earthy color of their uniforms, these general-population prisoners are called. At the entrance to A Block, I bump into Omar, who flashes me a gummy smile. He&#x2019;s been thinking about me, he says. When I ask him why, he says he&#x2019;ll come down and let me know just as soon as he gets himself some teeth. <br>Between B and C, I come upon Mamduh, another chapel worker, with his young companion, Nasir, at his hip. Quiet, if not soft-spoken, Mamduh, who is from North Philadelphia, has sharp eyes and a scraggly beard that covers most of his pockmarked face, and he looks older than the 1961 birth date claimed by the ID he once showed me to prove it. During the Tuesday-afternoon and Wednesday-night activity blocks, when the Muslims are slotted for the annex, Mamduh instructs a small group of men in Arabic language and grammar. <br>Mamduh encourages me to come to his Ethics of War class, to take place at 1:30 in the school. The class is an offering of Villanova&#x2019;s Associate&#x2019;s Degree Program, which the nearby Catholic university has run for over a generation. Many of the chapel workers and regulars are also college students in the Villanova Program, an overlap that contributes to the commonly shared perception of this cadre as being among the most serious men in the jail. <br>I won&#x2019;t make it to the school, I tell Mamduh, but I&#x2019;ll be sure to catch him later on. As Mamduh recedes, I notice him limping and wonder if something happened over the weekend or whether this isn&#x2019;t simply the way he walks, one more thing that in my overfamiliarity I&#x2019;ve come to overlook. <br>The side yard between C and D blocks is empty at this early hour, as is the chain-link enclosure beyond E Block, where the &#x201c;blues&#x201d; have their yard. <br>The chapel door is unlocked. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Watkins, an African-American correctional officer from nearby Phoenixville, is perched at his desk, his elbows splayed and his arched hands clasped. A navy-blue PA DOC baseball cap is perched high on his forehead, its bent brim low. Weekends were good, we establish. Without apparent agenda, Watkins asks me if I&#x2019;ve been to church as of late. <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I say, pointing downward. &#x201c;Here. Almost every day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What about on the outside?&#x201d; he asks. &#x201c;Synagogue or anything?&#x201d; <br>I signal the negative. And though I&#x2019;ve been a thrice-a-year Jew for a decade, I add, apologetically, &#x201c;These things go in cycles.&#x201d; <br>Watkins empathizes. &#x201c;It <i>has to be</i> that way,&#x201d; he says. <br>While Watkins has long since stopped taking too much notice of my comings and goings, I warn him that he&#x2019;s likely to see a fair amount of me in the weeks ahead. For an intended chapter recounting a week in the life of the chapel, I explain that I&#x2019;m going to be here all day, every day this week, instead of the three to four partial days that is my normal pattern. Watkins nods his head, squints his eyes, and asks&#x2014;or suggests&#x2014;in a hushed voice, if, when I&#x2019;m done, I&#x2019;m going to &#x201c;break him off a piece.&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t understand. <br>He looks me in the eye and clarifies: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s my cut for the movie going to be?&#x201d; <br>While no small number of prisoners have me pegged in some way or another as a mark, most commonly one heaven-sent by a meddling deity as part of His plan to secure their freedom, it has been the chapel&#x2019;s correctional officers who have been most overt in their plays for financial remuneration for their participation in my research. Watkins&#x2019;s predecessor tried to solicit my bid for his notebooks documenting twenty years of salacious goings-on in the jail, but Watkins has hitched his cart to my project&#x2019;s movie-rights star. <br>I play along. &#x201c;Fifty-fifty,&#x201d; I promise him in deadpan. &#x201c;Just you and me.&#x201d; Apparently finding the terms favorable, Watkins purses his lips and nods. <br>In the opposite corner of the vestibule, the maroon-clad Jack has a bottle of Windex in his right hand, a wad of paper towel in his left, and is scrubbing the small, square window in the door to the Catholic suite. Jack, who in the past has stated his preference that the role of Jack be played by George Clooney (though Watkins, with a colder eye, suggests <i>Seinfeld</i>&#x2019;s Jason Alexander to be a better match), is a short, bald, bulbous-headed Irish-American in his late forties. Jack works as a chapel janitor and helps out Father Gorski in the Catholic office. As has Mamduh, Jack has been scrupulous in bringing to my attention people and things to which he thinks I should attend, once going so far as to attempt to schedule a rendezvous with an Aryan Nation guy he knows from the block. As he assured me, while the two of them get along fine, they are in no way aligned. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be a member of any master race that would have me for a member,&#x201d; Jack explained. Proposing that I blow him instead, the Nazi declined. <br>Jack looks at me with puzzlement. &#x201c;There are no services on Mondays,&#x201d; he says. Translation: What the hell are <i>you</i> doing here? <br>I explain. <br>&#x201c;So what goes on on Mondays?&#x201d; I ask. <br>&#x201c;A lot of this,&#x201d; he says, holding up his Windex. Jack edges over to tell me about a book he read over the weekend&#x2014;a biography of the founder of the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic fraternal organization.3 I ask Jack whose book it is. It&#x2019;s his, he explains, but the guys in the Catholic community will all pass it around. They do the same with the <i>National Review</i>, he adds leadingly, digging at our political differences. Affecting a mock conspiratorial air, Jack looks behind each shoulder before saying that he could slip the book to me, just as sometime back he&#x2019;d lent me a right-wing radio talk-show host&#x2019;s political-conversion memoir. Affecting the same air, I ask him to please do just that.4 <br>Jack can be alternately magnanimous or dyspeptic. He often seems hungry for exchange, but he tends to lead with a jagged edge. His rage is channeled primarily through the culture war in whose stark light I&#x2019;m an America-hating, Israel-betraying, homosexual-agenda-pushing cancer on our great nation. When politics fails, Jack falls back on sports, where my New York allegiances align me, again, with the forces of evil. Jack likes to bait, and more often than not I&#x2019;m happy to be baited. Together we walk from the vestibule into the chapel. He offers me some coffee, which I decline, saying that I need to be mindful because I haven&#x2019;t been sleeping. <br>&#x201c;Liberal guilt!&#x201d; Jack diagnoses, and walks away. The truth is that I&#x2019;m jet-lagged from a trip overseas, but this I do not advertise. <br>Jack returns with a peace offering: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if this will help you, but you know how they say how there&#x2019;re no atheists in the foxhole? Well, when I was arrested, the first person I asked to talk to was a priest.&#x201d; After a slight hesitation, Jack says it&#x2019;s on his mind since he only recently learned of the priest&#x2019;s passing. <br>Following mass on Saturday night, Jack further informs me, they convened the first installment of the monthly Spanish-language Bible study. I&#x2019;m pleased to hear it, I tell Jack, because I know Father Gorski has been trying to get something like that off the ground. Jack underscores the alienation the Spanish-speaking Catholics feel at the English-language mass. <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re losing them all to the Evangelicals?&#x201d; I ask, presuming that developments at Graterford accord with wider cultural trends.5 <br>Jack grimaces playfully. <br>There has been a lightness to Jack of late. I know he&#x2019;s recently doubled his dose of Prozac, which has drawn some color back into his cheeks. Meanwhile, he&#x2019;s also been edging toward coming out of the closet as a Christian Scientist. He has been confessing his divided allegiance to me since I first arrived at the prison, but has yet to tell his father or sister. And though it&#x2019;s been years since official policy restricted a prisoner to the religious services of the group with which he is administratively identified, and while to my knowledge no one is forcing him to choose, Jack is conflicted. From the time he first picked it up eighteen months earlier, he has found in Mary Baker Eddy&#x2019;s <i>Science and Health</i> a powerful witness that fills him with hope and makes him feel like he&#x2019;s finally getting some things under control. But as much as he enjoys his Sunday studies and the visits of his spiritual advisor, Jack&#x2014;a perennial altar boy&#x2014;worries that he is neglecting the Virgin Mary and therefore dishonoring the memory of his mother. So he gives equal time to his Catholic observances, especially to counting the rosary, when Jack likes to focus on Mary&#x2019;s assumption to heaven and the grace of a happy death. <br>Religious boundary crossing of Jack&#x2019;s sort is, in the chapel, hardly unusual, but it is generally cast as a passing phase. Sure, one is free to sample and search, but ultimately, as Jack would be the first to tell you, a man must choose. And so, in pursuit of coherence as much as grace, Jack experiences his balancing act as a stopgap, a hedging of bets before he takes his money off the table and settles back into his life as a Catholic or lets it ride on the healing Jesus he&#x2019;s come to know through the Church of Christ, Scientist.6 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Baraka jerks his head over his right shoulder, fixes on my eyes, registers surprise, and saunters into the chapel with his hand outstretched. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; he asks with a cock of his head and an interrogative flick of his wrist, &#x201c;what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; <br>Save for a narrow ridge of goatee, Baraka is clean-shaven, and his tiger-print glasses frame his almond eyes. Often, as today, his browns are almost pink, an ancient vintage prized for its softer fabric, and by now worn almost to parchment. Baraka is the Imam&#x2019;s clerk and my most crucial interlocutor. (For different reasons, he and I both are made uneasy by the classical anthropological term <i>informant</i>.)7 In practice, he might well be my dissertation advisor. Most crucially, Baraka is the person I commonly consult to make sense of what is real and what is not in this strange place. It is a need that Baraka alternately satisfies and thwarts. With his conviction that &#x201c;things are far more simple than they appear,&#x201d; Baraka sells me on the importance of reading surfaces. This clarifying interpretive principle, however, is wholly at odds with a second position Baraka advocates with equal insistence: that &#x201c; <i>everything</i> one sees in here is real&#x201d; (and therefore dicey), the feints and dodges no less so than the brutally honest confessions. <br>To his question of &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; I answer that I have insomnia. With sarcasm, he asks if I&#x2019;m anxious. Confronted with the same formula last week, I&#x2019;d misguidedly confessed to being preoccupied with concerns over where my paycheck was to come from come July, in particular whether I&#x2019;m going to get the job at the nearby college for which I&#x2019;ve been shortlisted. Baraka greeted my disclosure of academic job-market anxiety with equal measures of incredulity and intolerance, berating me for being &#x201c;like a cork in the ocean.&#x201d; <br>Like many of the chapel regulars, Baraka preaches the virtues of self-mastery. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t have mastery over yourself, then you&#x2019;re just reacting,&#x201d; he has said.

He has little patience for those who fixate on what they&#x2019;ve done, what they&#x2019;ve lost, or where they might be headed when they die.

They enjoy exploring history through French and Indian War re-enactment and through medieval re-enactment in the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). Debbie grew up in southwestern Vermont, where she heard and collected many family stories that she enjoys retelling as historical fiction for young audiences, and as family and local history for genealogists, as well as memory stories of her own life. Debbie graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in dual majors of social sciences with an education concentration and of English in 2013. She is on hiatus from pursuing her master&#x2019;s degree in linguistics, specializing in teaching English as a second language (TESOL), at Oakland University, in Rochester, Michigan, as a result of going blind and battling long-term illness. Debbie went blind suddenly, without obvious cause, on December 15, 2014, at the age of 45. Her family, friends, and doctors expected her to give in to the darkness and become bitter and angry. Instead, Debbie chose to adopt a positive attitude, even when she felt anything but positive, and to find as much light as possible in her life. She wrote an autobiographical account of her first full year of living in the twilight semi-vision of blindness to share her experience with others; it was also therapy to help her face the darkness. Before going blind, Debbie was an avid, even voracious, reader. She enjoyed drawing in many traditional media and painting in acrylic, gouache, and watercolor. She enjoyed sewing, crocheting, needlepoint, embroidery, beadwork, spinning, and weaving. Since going blind, Debbie has turned to audio books from Audible.com, BARD Talking Books Library, and on CDs. She crochets blankets and crochets scarves for charity. She makes paper beads to make rosaries for the missions. She has recently begun exploring resuming drawing and painting with the limitations of her vision. Debbie is an active member of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA). She is a past member of the LEO Club, the Lions Club, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), the Girl Scouts, the Explorer Scouts, and the Order of the Eastern Star (OES), as well as various academic and social groups in high school, college, and graduate school.

The elements at play: A beautiful actress with whom he finds himself falling in love after a quick glimpse of her in a passing taxi ... an odd, new, business associate whose hiring, firing and rehiring make little sense ... a rock musician whose loss -- in this case of his mind -- may be "adjusted" by the insurance company. What ties it all together: a web of fraud in which virtually everyone he knows is somewhat involved, a web in which he finds himself being increasingly entangled.</p><p>Lorimer Black may suffer from a serious sleep disorder and an obsession with the labyrinths of the British class system, but <i>Armadillo</i>'s peculiar protagonist <i>is</i> the star insurance adjuster of London's Fortress Sure PLC, unaffectionately known as the Fort. At the very start of William Boyd's <i>noir</i>-ish seventh novel, however, things take a decided swerve for the worse. On a bleak January morning one of his cases has apparently chosen to kill himself rather than talk: "Mr. Dupree was simultaneously the first dead person he had encountered in his life, his first suicide and his first hanged man and Lorimer found this congruence of firsts deceptively troubling."<p> Soon our hero, who himself has a lot to hide, finds himself threatened by a dodgy type whose loss he has adjusted way down and embroiled with the beautiful married actress Flavia Malinverno. "People who've lost something, they call on you to adjust it, make the loss less hard to bear? As if their lives are broken in some way and they call on you to fix it," Flavia dippily wonders. Lorimer also has his car torched and instantly goes from an object of affection to one of deep suspicion at the Fort. Then there is another case, the small matter of the rock star who may or may not be faking the Devil he says is sitting on his left shoulder. </p><p> Needless to say, Lorimer is "becoming fed up with this role of fall guy for other people's woes." Boyd adds a deep layer of psychological heft and a lighter level of humor to this thinking-person's thriller by exploring Lorimer's manifold personal and social fears. This is a man who desperately collects ancient helmets even though he knows they offer only "the illusion of protection." Another of <i>Armadillo</i>'s many pleasures: its dose of delicious argot. Should Lorimer "oil" the apparent perpetrator of the Fedora Palace arson before he's oiled himself? Or perhaps he just needs to "put the frighteners" on him. Boyd definitely puts the frighteners on his readers more than once in this cinematically seedy and dazzling literary display. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"Darkly comic"<br>--<i>Booklist</i><p>"Everything good fiction should be...It begins with a jolt...and then goes on to become even<br>better"<br>--David Nicholson, <i>Washington Post</i></p><p>"A satirical noir...probing, droll, and full of rewards"<br>--Ben Greenman, <i>Time Out</i></p><p>"A real page-turner"<br>--<i>The Observer</i>, London</p><p>"Zesty &amp; brilliantly on-target...Lorimer's adventures have enough of an alarming edge to keep a reader constantly, and delightedly, off balance"<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Every Man in This Village Is a Liar: An Education in War</h2><p><b>A shattering account of war and disillusionment from a young woman reporter on the front lines of the war on terror.&nbsp;</b><br><br>A few weeks after the planes crashed into the World Trade Center, journalist Megan K.

Documenting Wentworth&#x2019;s ongoing series <i>Making Do and Getting By</i>, the book&#x2019;s 750 images document excess--a creativity beyond functionality, something transformative that lurks beneath the surface intention in acts of ordering and repair.

These include uncommon cocktails, varieties of coffee and milk, and such iconic creations as Welch's Grape Juice, Coca-Cola, root beer, and Kool-Aid. Involved in their creation and promotion were entrepreneurs and environmentalists, bartenders and bottlers, politicians and lobbyists, organized and unorganized criminals, teetotalers and drunks, German and Italian immigrants, savvy advertisers and gullible consumers, prohibitionists and medical professionals, and everyday Americans in love with their brew. <br><br>Smith weaves a wild history full of surprising stories and explanations for such classic slogans as "taxation with and without representation;" "the lips that touch wine will never touch mine;" and "rum, Romanism, and rebellion."

One hundred and forty men reached land. Only thirty-six made it back home. <i>The "Wager" Disaster</i> is the extraordinary story of human endurance and the perseverance of those soldiers in the face of unthinkable adversity.<br><br> Britain and Spain were at war, and the <i>Wager</i> was part of a small British squadron sent to extend the battle to their Spanish possessions in the South Seas. Unfortunately, there were no accurate charts of the west coast of South America, and much of the navigation was determined by guesswork. Vicious hurricane-force winds wrecked the <i>Wager</i>, separating it from the squadron. Starvation, exhaustion, hypothermia, and drowning quickly claimed most of the soldiers who survived the wreck. The rest rose up against the unpopular captain and set off in an open boat with no chart, resulting in one of the greatest survival voyages as the castaways made their way 2,500 nautical miles back to Britain.<br><br> Drawing on the firsthand accounts of the survivors, <i>The "Wager" Disaster</i> tells the compelling story of a dramatic fight for survival under extreme conditions.</p><p><b>Rear Admiral C.

(<i>Rum Ration</i>)<br><br>"This book is far more than a heroic story of British seagoing endurance, though the 2,500&#x2013;mile voyage of a handful of starving, desperate seamen in an open long-boat round South America is in itself epic. But the narratives of the &#x2018;Wager&#x2019;survivors, now collected and edited by Admiral Layman, are infinitely richer than any one-dimensional Victorian tale of British grit. They are tales of horrific, often repulsive suffering; they are sinister mysteries; they are tales of moral dilemmas.<br><br> Above all, these narratives present us with a cast of extraordinary, vivid human characters.&nbsp; Some are struggling with their consciences; some are obsessed with hatred and fear. There are steady and resourceful men who nevertheless let the weak die in order to save the strong; there are traitors determined to reach safety so that they can denounce their own shipmates.&nbsp; And &#x2013; most fortunately for us &#x2013; there are a few marvelous young men who never stopped observing the places and peoples they encountered and somehow &#x2013; in the face of ghastly extremities &#x2013; recording them with wonder and in detail.&nbsp;Almost forgotten for more than a century, the &#x2018;Wager&#x2019; story in all its fearsome complexity and tragic horror is now returned to us in lasting and well-illustrated form."

Exploring themes universal to all people, <i>Pope Francis&#x2019; Little Book of Compassion</i> offers inspiration and hope from one of the world&#x2019;s great spiritual leaders. In it, the Holy Father explores how living a life of compassion can be practiced in five areas of life: prayer, mercy, forgiveness, solidarity, and charity.</p><p>Pope Francis appears to be changing the face of Roman Catholicism. He has infused the fusty institution with openness and optimism, faced off against established power interests within the Vatican, reformed the Church&#x2019;s finances, and, most importantly, asked that Catholics approach one another and non-Catholics with candor, humility, and love. He has made the papacy and the Church relevant once again.</p><p>Words from Pope Francis:<br><i>&#x201c;A little bit of mercy makes the world less cold and more just.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There is so much indifference in the face of suffering. May we overcome indifference with concrete acts of charity."</i></p></p><p><b>Andrea Kirk Assaf</b> has covered three pontificates for <i>Inside the Vatican</i> magazine and several other news outlets. She divides her time between Rome and Remus, Michigan."Compassion, "to suffer with," as it appears in this palm-sized book compiling quotes excerpted from Pope Francis's public remarks, is more than a feeling. It is action, explains journalist Assaf, who has covered three pontificates and written for Inside the Vatican. She notes that, in Christian terms, compassion begins with receiving the compassion of God. The wisdoms and lessons gathered here, intended to inspire readers to act as agents of healing, forgiveness, and joy, presume familiarity with the vocabulary and syntax of traditional Christianity, but the book's main parts (arranged into the categories of mercy, prayer, forgiveness, solidarity, charity and service, hospitality, and Jesus) aren't complicated theological arguments. Instead, Assaf provides ecumenical reminders for kindness and care. The words of Pope Francis, known for his manner of humility, strong openness, and transparent concern, lend these gems particular resonance. Readers may take issue with details such as the categorization of particular quotes, but they will value the timeless reminders to "[find] God in every human being" or to complete prayer with action." --<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><i><i>, (January 2017)--Reviews</i></i></p><h2>Lobster Pot Cookbook</h2><p>The Lobster Pot is pleased to announce the release of its new cookbook.

Through the media of motion pictures, art books, T.V. documentaries and dramas such as Shogun, as well as through personal experience, more and more people have gained an acquaintance and appreciation of the architecture of premodern Japan. Some may even be able to name or recognize the oldest and the largest wooden structures in existence, which are to be found in Japan at Horyuji and Todaiji respectively. Yet often this knowledge is still rudimentary. Confusion abounds as to what distinguishes Japanese architecture from Chinese or Korean, or even Southeast Asian, not to mention what sets off a Buddhist temple from a Shinto shrine or, say, a residence of the tenth century from one of the eighteenth. Until now, there has been no recourse for those seeking, through a single book, to increase their appreciation of the whole range of traditional Japanese architecture. With the publication of What Is Japanese Architecture?, however, this situation has finally been rectified. Construction, design, carpentry, and the background of Japanese architecture, from prehistory to mid-nineteenth century, are here made available within the covers of a single, compact book. <br><br>With over 300 drawings that illuminate the essentials of discussion more concretely than words could ever do, and a text that is succinct and always to the point, the book is divided into four parts-one each dealing chronologically with religious structures, residences, castles, and places of entertainment. The reader learns not only how each of these fields of architecture has evolved over the centuries and what distinguishes the buildings of one age from those of another, but something of the historical conditions and the people responsible for these changes as well as the role played by carpentry and methods of construction. The establishment and growth of the historic Japanese capitals-Nara, Kyoto, Edo-is brought sharply into focus, along with the rise and spread of other urban centers. Also highlighted are the mansions of the court nobility; the castles and residences of the samurai aristocracy; the homes of village elders; dwellings of the common people; educational institutions, and places of entertainment such as theaters, red-light districts, teahouses, and country villas. <br><br>Any book that is as full of information as this, and readily accessible and clearly illustrated at the same time, will be of great interest and use to a wide range of people-architects, designers, historians, carpenters, movie buffs, tourists, garden designers, and others, whether amateur or professional. Whatever the readers' background, there is little doubt about one thing: they will emerge with an acuter eye and a greater sensitivity to the delights of traditional Japanese architecture.</p><p><br>KAZUO NISHI (b. 1938) graduated from Waseda University in 1962 and received his doctorate from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1967.

Created by the Emmy-Award winning producers of Batman: The Animated Series.</p><p>The trend in superheroes of the late 1980s was dark, grim, gritty, and not very kid friendly. Then along came the animated Batman series. The visual style was totally unique: clean, sharp, and bold. <i>Batman Adventures: Mad Love</i> is an original comics story drawn in the style of the popular animated series. It's even put together by Paul Dini, a major force behind the animated show. This particular story involves Batman's old foe, the Joker, and Joker's cute but deadly sidekick, Harley Quinn. Actor Mark Hamill of <i>Star Wars</i> fame, who plays the voice of the Joker in the animated series, claims that this is one of his all-time favorite comics, calling it "bold, lusty, gleefully demented."Paul Dini is a multiple Emmy and Eisner Award-winning writer and producer who has helped redefine the legends of the DC Universe in such series as <i>The New Batman/Superman Adventures</i>, <i>Batman Beyond, Krypto </i>and <i>Justice League Unlimited. </i>In comics he has authored THE WORLD'S GREATEST SUPER-HEROES, illustrated by Alex Ross.

While most young men are being sent away to fight the Germans, Ben is chosen to serve on English soil. Ordered to move to wild, beautiful Cornwall, he must trade his posh London office and stylish city life for the tiny village of Birdswing, population 1,221 souls. But leaving his home and shelving his career ambitions aren't the only sacrifices facing Ben. His unfaithful wife, Penny, is accompanying him to Cornwall in a last-ditch effort to save their marriage. But moments after their arrival, Penny is run down in the street, and Ben is almost fatally injured. And while the villagers assume Penny's death to be an accident, Ben quickly deduces it was murder.&nbsp;<br><br>As he convalesces in Fenton House, which the locals call haunted, Ben meets Birdswing's eccentric inhabitants. Mr. Gaston, the volunteer air warden, obsessed with defending his remote village against Nazi spies; Mrs. Cobblepot, a thoroughly practical housekeeper who believes in fairies; and Lady Juliet Linton, a prickly, headstrong aristocrat who won't take no for an answer.

The Congress orders Bethlehem to house prisoners of war. And the General Hospital of the Continental Army is set up there. When the British occupy the capital city of Philadelphia, 700 supply wagons arrive in Bethlehem. Although the Moravians do not believe in war, they want to help their country in peaceful ways. They cheerfully give up their buildings to house wounded soldiers and give food and clothing to the hungry army. It is the beginning of exciting times for Kate and her young cousin, Andrew. With their Indian friend, Brother Aaron, they help an escaped Hessian drummer boy avoid capture by the American guards. And the young Marquis de Lafayette, a French nobleman who brought a ship and sailed to the colonies to help in the fight for freedom, comes to Bethlehem to recuperate from his wounds.</p><p>Grade 5-8-- A novel about the Moravians' involvement in the American Revolution, with customs and beliefs deftly blended into the story. Kate Rau, 15, lives with her aunt and uncle because her parents are missionaries among the Indians. The war affects them, first as one cousin defies Moravian tradition and joins the militia, and then when Hessian prisoners and later wounded Americans are sent to their town of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Kate becomes involved in nursing the soldiers and thus experiences some of the horrors of war. The appearance of a long-lost uncle, captured as a child by Indians, ties things together a bit too neatly, and characterization is a little superficial. While lacking in depth, this portrayal of Moravian life and the choice of pacifism is interesting enough to make it worth reading. Mediocre black-and-white illustrations add little. --Jane Gardner Connor, formerly at South Carolina State Library, Columbia<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Advanced Framing: Advanced Framing Technqiues, Troubleshooting &amp; Structural Design</h2><p>This book contains 46 of the best framing articles published in JLC - all written by hands-on experts.

This book&#39;s title, Settlement, refers to the Jewish communities built in the region of the former state of Palestine known as the West Bank, an area of approximately 2,173 square miles, between the Jordan River and Jerusalem. The area was occupied by Israel in 1968, in the aftermath of the Six-Day War; Israel&#39;s right to govern is not recognised by the United Nations, which deems any Israeli building in this area to be a violation of international law. The book investigates the topography of Jewish identity in the West Bank, which is in conflict not only with the Palestinian majority but also with mainstream Israeli society: While all the settlers are Jewish, and almost all are Israeli citizens, many are not natives of Israel. Most of the men and women photographed by Waplington are immigrants who arrived in the West Bank from the United States, South Africa, Australia, the UK, the former Soviet Union, and other parts of the wider Jewish diaspora. The exact number of settlements cannot be determined with accuracy, as both construction and demolition take place regularly throughout the region. In general, however, the presence of Jewish settlers in the West Bank is entrenched, and their building projects continue with the support of the state of Israel. Nick Waplington is a British photographer born in Aden, Yemen. His work is held in collections of the Guggenheim Museum, MoMA, and London&#39;s Victoria and Albert Museum. Settlement is part of a project entitled This Place, which explores the complexity of Israel and the West Bank through the eyes of twelve internationally acclaimed photographers.</p><p></p><h2>Japan Style</h2><p>Striking photographs and brief essays attempt to define the style of Japan in terms of elegance, simplicity, compactness, vitality, and other qualities</p><p></p><h2>Where to Find It in the Bible: The Ultimate A to Z Resource</h2><p><p><b>Locate specific Bible references to over 3,700 contemporary subjects with this Ultimate A to Z Resource. </b><i>Where to Find it in the Bible</i> is a unique topical concordance that helps you find biblical passages that apply to traditional and 21st-century topics. <br></p><p>Features:<br></p><ul><li>Readily accessible<br> </li><li>Works with many translations</li><li>Easy to apply information<br> </li></ul></p><p><p>Ken Anderson was a free-lance writer for more than half a century, authoring some forty books, hundreds of magazine articles and short stories.

Now his subtly nuanced attention turns to a different kind of text: the experiences of his own life.<br>Throughout his luminous, witty memoir, Kermode touches on deeper, lighter, ineffable issues of autobiography, and he does so with his characteristic grace and precision. In Not Entitled, the miraculous connections between life and literature, between the world and the word, are transformed and ennobled.</p><p><p><b>Frank Kermode </b>has written and edited many works, including <i>Forms of Meaning </i>and <i>The Oxford Book of Letters</i>. He lived in Cambridge, England, and taught frequently in the United States.</p>In this enchanting, episodic memoir, Kermode chronicles the unusual course of events that carried him from a parochial childhood on the Isle of Man to international recognition as a literary critic. A modest, at times dolefully confessional raconteur, Kermode elides most details about his marriages and children, focusing instead upon his own perpetual feelings of dislocation and his lack of "entitlement" to cultural and familial attainments. Raised in a world of tenements, gaslights and ancient prejudices, the sensitive Kermode joined the navy at the outset of WWII, serving as clerk to a series of "mad captains" (including two Sisyphian years in Iceland building a naval defense that was never completed). Kermode next drifted into graduate school, later teaching at Reading, Bristol and University College of London, eventually becoming King Edward VII Professor of English at Cambridge, a post he resigned during a much-publicized controversy over post-structuralism during the early 1980s. Kermode also details the flap over his editorship of the cultural journal Encounter, which he left on principle in 1967 when it was revealed to be CIA-funded. And, through a marvelous prism of literary and cultural observations, Kermode, whose most famous book is The Sense of an Ending, affectingly ponders his own sense of mortality. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Living With the Passive Aggressive Man</h2><p>A guide to dealing with the destructive syndrome of passive-aggressiveness, in oneself and in others, offers a blueprint for dealing with the problems this syndrome causes, showing readers how to identify the passive-aggressive personality. 35,000 first printing.

"Yes, no!" "Stop, go!" "I never lie, I was just protecting you from the truth!" <i>What does he mean?</i> The King of Hearts and most passive-aggressive men share the maddening characteristic of never saying exactly what they mean.<br><br>He may be a legal wizard, a computer genius, a brilliant analytical scientist or a guy who runs a newsstand, but when it comes to relating to others, the passive-aggressive man has just learned to read. <i>He's</i> as unclear about why he does what he does as you are about his behavior.<br><br>When patients describe his psychological abuse, they often begin the same way: "This guy is <i>impossible."</i> "This guy is <i>difficult."</i> "Every meal, every conversation and everything we decide to do is handled like we' re two warring nations negotiating a pact, not two people who care about each other," one woman told me. She could be talking for other women about their husbands, fathers, bosses, the shoemaker.<br><br>What's the appeal of a guy who says in one breath, "I love you/I hate you," or, "I promise.../Why should I do anything for you?" If you have any emotional investment in a passive-aggressive man, it's because you've probably fallen for his salesmanship. He's brilliantly persuasive at selling himself -- whether it's his brooding stoicism, his understated charm, his boyishness or irresistible seductiveness. You buy into his elusiveness; but you also buy into his <i>neediness.</i> You feel for him and want to be the one who breaks through, who tears the walls down and gets him to shape up. In many cases, it is a thankless mission.<br><br>Problems arise with the passive-aggressive man because of his fatal flaw: an indirect and inappropriate way of expressing hostility hidden under the guise of innocence, generosity or passivity. If what he says or does confuses you, or, more likely, angers you, this is why. You're not the only one to react this way. It's what passive-aggression is all about.<br><br>INSIDE PASSIVE-AGGRESSION<br><br>A seemingly paradoxical term, passive-aggression asks the question, How can a person be passive <i>and</i> aggressive, rather than one way or the other? It's a common misconception about passive-aggression that its perpetrators swing alternately between the two behaviors -- either willfully with premeditation to control others (aggression) or in a self-effacing manner (passivity).<br><br>The truth is that the passive-aggressive man doesn't ride an emotional seesaw (although he may put you on one); he's not passive today and aggressive tomorrow, depending on the circumstances. Rather, the passive-aggressive man is simultaneously passive and aggressive. The paradox reigns because he <i>renounces his aggression as it is happening.</i><br><br>Since passivity and aggression are contradictory by origin and act, you can see that we are dealing with a complex and fundamentally ambivalent creature.<br><br>Passive-aggressive tactics aren't that easily read at first; it takes a while to figure out what this guy is getting at: the blur of meaning lies in his genius for creating discrepancies between how he pretends to be and how he acts, which is a better indicator of his true intentions and feelings. You're always receiving mixed messages because he wants you to guess what he wants almost as much as he wants to fool you or string you along. This is what his double-speak can sound like:<br><br>-- "I can't live without you," a passive-aggressive boyfriend says as he kisses you and leaves the room. Or, when the two of you are alone, he asks "Why are you around all the time?" when he means, <i>I'm terrified that you'll leave me.</i><br><br>-- "Are you interested...?" a passive-aggressive husband may whisper to a wife who makes an affectionate advance toward him, while what he is really thinking is, <i>Why am I asking her when I'm not that turned on?</i> Or he says, contrarily, "Sometimes sex is overrated," when he means, <i>I want you,</i> all the while expecting his wife to know that he wants to be seduced.<br><br>-- "We've noticed your administrative skills and would like to discuss a special project that's coming up," a passive-aggressive boss says flatteringly, hinting at a promotion, but then you never hear from him again. What he really meant was: <i>What makes you think I'd even consider you for that secret project, and how'd you find out about it anyway?</i><br><br>Or, he might try a version of this empty promise:<br><br>-- "Okay, I know I promised to pick up your kitchen stuff at Sue's place, but my car broke down. Maybe tomorrow..." a passive-aggressive brother assures you, but he's thinking, <i>Why do you keep asking me to do anything involving Sue when you know I can't stand the sight of her, and besides, I hate hauling freight in my new car.</i><br><br>-- Or, a passive-aggressive friend says, "I wanted to be the first one to buy you a disk for your new CD player...something <i>really</i> great, something you'll love -- eighteenth-century harpsichord favorites that took me a week to find for you," but what he thinks is, <i>This should let you know how low-brow your taste in music is. Your idea of culture is the Miami Sound Machine.</i><br><br>The man in each of these examples isn't playing diplomat; his baiting behavior isn't <i>inadvertent,</i> though he hopes you'll think it is. This is a man who's driven to appear above suspicion, guiltless and guileless. That's why you find that most passive-aggressive men negotiate the world as "nice guys" denying even the slightest hint of hostility or conflict.<br><br>As with a brother who'll easily break a promise five or ten times rather than just say, "No, sorry, I can't," this man will lie to keep you on a string until the game reaches its limit and he's finally forced -- by you -- to confess that he can't come through. If he's someone who's been in your life a long time, you may find you're always arguing about the same thing, year after year. Most of all, you wonder why you still jump through the same flaming hoops he holds up, how he can still get a rise out of you.<br><br>If you're typical, and at the end of your rope with him, you may fantasize about ending your relationship -- and this includes abandoning relationships with "impossible" relatives, like fathers and brothers. But you don't act on it. Or, if he's a key player sorely affecting your job, you might just give up and quit, but the passive-aggressive colleague you leave behind won't believe he's done anything to obstruct your career. More likely, he expects a huge pat on the back for <i>doing everything</i> to boost your efforts and calls you ungrateful, to boot.<br><br>Whoever he is, your relationship with a passive-aggressive man probably leaves you feeling unsettled and insecure, wondering why you're always at an emotional crossroad. Most of all, you wonder how to make your life with him a better place to be. Before I get to the latter, I'll take you through what makes him tick and keeps him running. The passive-aggressive man's <i>modus operandi</i> has two primary component parts: passivity and aggression. Let's begin there.<br><br>A CLOSE LOOK AT PASSIVITY<br><br>When it's used as a power play against you, <i>passivity</i> can rouse you to anger just as much as an active display of hostility. But why does someone's <i>in</i>action so anger you?<br><br>The answer lies in the qualities that make up "passivity." Traditionally, a passive person shows little initiative in getting what he wants; assertion is a labor and comes about hesitantly, if at all. Male passivity covers a wide range of behavior, from the classic "loser" -- the weak, inept type who has a hard time keeping a job -- to the "conformist" -- the man who rolls with the current, buoyed by approval seeking, not making waves, changing his opinions in order to be liked and rarely stating what he feels and thinks at any moment.<br><br>In certain corporate or bureaucratic circles, he's the yesman. On occasion, his quick-change sentiments delivered to the right person at the right time may serve to get him what he wants. As <i>a guy who just wants to fit in,</i> he may reach some level of success, but he's a poor leader and decision maker; he avoids big responsibilities, and he'll stop short of a top spot. As he sees it, others are better able to make the right decisions.<br><br><i>"This man's a baby.</i> He's sharp, he's charming, but emotionally, he's about four years old!" women say, and they're right. Passive people -- and here I include women, too -- all suffer because they haven't quite grown up. They're childlike and continue to rely on others.<br><br>Larry is a good example of passive dependency. An engineer in the construction business, he can never remember to bring cash, check, or credit card when he goes out to dinner. It isn't that Larry is cheap; rather, he has a compulsion to get others to pay for his meal -- he needs you to feed him. His excuses take the same unrealistic and juvenile line of thinking as, "The dog ate my term paper." You don't believe Larry's story, but it is that boyish, ingratiating look -- that need to be loved and forgiven -- that suckers certain of us who take to babying him.<br><br>That Larry needs to be "nurtured" by someone with money -- that is, an adult with power -- makes him passive; that he has to <i>trick</i> you into doing it makes him <i>passive-aggressive.</i><br><br>You'll find that passive men and the more complicated passive-aggressive men have a trait in common: both are reluctant to assert themselves directly, in a firm but tactful way. They shun and fear <i>self-assertion,</i> mistaking it for unleashed aggression. The consequences of assertion scare them. Their internal line of thinking goes something like this: "If I do this, straight out and simply, I'm telling you what I think, what I'm going to do or what I feel. This leaves me open to a possible challenge, disagreement or loss of support."<br><br>This emotion-packed reasoning haunts them: If asserting themselves brings them into direct confrontation with others, what will happen next? Could they handle an attack? Self-doubt tells them they would not be able to, so they do what they can to avoid confrontation, winding and weaving all over the map. To passive and passive-aggressive personalities, denial and avoidance offer a safe haven. This is one reason why the roads in a passive-aggressive man's life lead to detours, dead ends or clover-leaf turns that circle back to the starting point: going <i>forward</i> puts him on his bumpiest road.<br><br>The passive-aggressive man pretends to be passive, when he's not that way at all. What underlies his apparent passivity -- his fear and dependency -- is aggression, pure and simple. And this is what rouses you to anger, makes you feel tricked. The passive personality is never infuriating because he poses no challenge; the passive-aggressive personality, however, is constantly giving you little tastes of his hostility in doses just large enough to irritate you.<br><br><i>Aggression</i> is the other side of the issue. While passivity brings out restraint, inhibition, and a life without much challenge or "juice," aggression evokes images of force, energy and push. Together they add up to a mixed-up view of his power as a man.<br><br>A CLOSE LOOK AT AGGRESSION<br><br>Aggression, a basic drive older than predawn man, is often thought of as man's failing -- a dubious impulse equated with hostility, tyranny, anger, dominance and bloodshed. Yet aggression exists within a wide range of experience, and everyone is motivated to some degree by aggressive impulses. A masked terrorist aiming an Uzi at a planeload of tourists is one kind of riotous aggressor; a rude shopper pushing his way to the front of a line in a bakery and demanding to be served reveals another kind of unbridled nerve; pitching a set of dishes at the kitchen wall during a fight is anger with impact; and a Jets quarterback whose guts and muscle win a football game describes aggression a fourth way.<br><br>Of the two impulses, it is aggression, not passivity, that commands greater attention by social, psychological, biological, ethical and religious scholars, scientists, researchers and philosophers. Perhaps it is the power and intensity of aggression that fascinates us; it's a force that can build or destroy with equal strokes. Aggression not only makes headlines, it gets things done. Yet, those who study it unanimously view aggression as something to be contained.<br><br>The messages from social theorists, for example, reckon that aggression swims the eternal tides of our primordial gene pools -- a remnant from the days before we were civilized and prowled the earth as animals. Aggression got us dinner, shelter and mates. It still does, but now it has a civilized veneer. However, some social theorists ask, with developed forebrains and space-age technologies, do we really need such impulses? Aggression, being more destructive than constructive, undoes the fabric of society, and results in war, crime and domestic violence. Theorists say we must control aggression, and we have built jails and a criminal justice system to do it.<br><br>Ethical philosophers, concerned only with behavior (action) not thoughts (unacted-upon ideas), inject aggression into a similar vein: to them, it's immoral. Their message is: behave in a hostile manner and you'll be judged harshly and suffer guilt that will follow you through life. Theologians, whose scope reaches to an individual's innermost soul, hold aggression as sinful and goodness as holy. Their message is more damning, full of brimstone and with even less understanding of the nature of man: don't feel anger or you'll go to hell. In quite different ways, each of these theories encourages the development of passive-aggression because they discourage the individual from acknowledging, or acting upon, his anger.<br><br>Psychology offers a contrasting message: everyone has aggressive impulses and it is beneficial for the individual's mental health to express them, but we must do so appropriately. If, for example, someone less talented and less experienced than you receives the promotion at work you want, it's not a good idea to show the anger you feel in any way that would sabotage your future possibilities of getting ahead. If you want to find out why you weren't promoted, you'd have to know your boss's style, how to approach him/her, in what manner to get the information you need and to know how much to say about your disappointment at losing out. You could even use your frustration to make yourself work that much harder.<br><br>But if you're annoyed because someone just recklessly cut in front of you on a highway, then it may be more appropriate to express yourself by word or gesture. Sometimes there are consequences -- maybe the guy tries another move to rear-end you in retaliation but, more likely, he'll respond, too, by word or gesture. This kind of direct and appropriate response is better than quietly seething, doing nothing or taking it out on someone else later on.<br><br>What humanity has in common is that we're all aggressive in some way. We also share the capacity to <i>judge</i> our aggressive acts, weighing them, comparing them, scrutinizing them, containing them. Were we too pushy, too loud, too demanding, too hostile, too prone to tantrums...?<br><br>As long as we're willing to take a look at how we're being aggressive, we can <i>hope</i> to control the impulse before it becomes destructive. What makes some people aggressive personalities is how <i>frequently</i> and <i>pervasively</i> they act on...</p><h2>Prarieblomman: The Prairie Blossoms for an Immigrant&#39;s Daughter (Book 2 in the Butter in the Well book series)</h2><p>Popular Kansas author Linda K. Hubalek continues the story of a Swedish immigrant family in Prarieblomman, the second book in the Butter in the Well series. Homesteading the Kansas prairie in 1869, Prairblomman features the diary of young Alma Swenson, as she grows up on the Kansas prairie that her parents homesteaded. Hubalek grew up in this same house, researching the land and family that lived on the farm before her.</p><p>In sixth grade we had to write a paper on what we wanted to do when we grew up. My mom had kept it and I found this paper while cleaning through my closet during my college days. According to my dreams back then, I wanted to be a farmer, but my last line was -but alas, girls can&#39;t be farmers. Well, I got my Bachelors Degree in Agriculture/Horticulture from Kansas State University, did agronomy research for years before starting a wholesale horticulture business. My company, Prairie Flower Creations, grew and dried flowers, ornamental corn, and mini pumpkins for the florist trade. In 1990 I was featured in Country Woman Magazine, but at the same time, my husband&#39;s job was transferred to California. I sold my business and tried to cope, growing flowers and pumpkins in five-gallon buckets on our cement lawn. I started writing about the family and farmland I was homesick for and started a new career, writing about women ancestors who had moved to the new state of Kansas and farmed its land. We eventually moved back to Kansas, bought land next to my family, raised buffalo, and I have a garden again. So not only have I fulfilled my dream to be a farmer, I&#39;ve written about past and present women that have also tilled the prairie land of Kansas. Please read and enjoy my book series which are about the family that homestead our family farm, and my ancestors that homesteaded in Kansas in the 1800s. Considered historical fiction, these quality paperback books are age appropriate for everyone from age 9 to 99. Book, quilt, and Scandinavian gift shops sell them (or ask your local store to stock them for you) and schools use them in class studies to portray early pioneer and Kansas history. My writing time most days is spent on the computer with marketing my businesses, and working on the next book series.Prarieblomman is a tender and touching diary...Hubalek has succeeded in blowing life into both Alma and the fascinating times she lived though.

In addition, Freud was led to revise his methods of treatment for neurotic patients by introducing the valuable technical adjunct of dream-interpretation and to develop, largely based on this work, his revolutionary theories of the Oedipus complex and on the profound importance of infantile life and sexuality for the development of adults.</p><p>Whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud, we all have to admit that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Much of this revolution can be traced to <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id, the superego, and their problem child, the ego, Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases and neuroses influenced his observations, the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud, our interior lives became richer and vastly more mysterious.<p> These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma, a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century, though now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, "Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime." One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Freud&#39;s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes.</p><h2>God&#39;s Gym</h2><p>God's Gym is the first story collection in more than a decade from one of our most celebrated American authors. A two-time winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award and a finalist for the National Book Award, John Edgar Wideman is a master of the short story. He was awarded the prestigious Rea Award for accomplishment in the short story form, and these electric, mesmerizing stories have appeared in numerous magazines, including Harper's Magazine, GQ, Playboy, Esquire, Callalloo, and Fiction, as well as in The Best American Short Stories.<br> God's Gym features stories that explore issues of strength and faith, fate and belief. In the first story, Wideman writes, "My mother believes in a god whose goodness would not permit him to inflict more troubles than a person can handle. A god of mercy and salvation. A sweaty, bleeding god presiding over a fitness class in which his chosen few punish their muscles. She should wear a T-shirt: God's Gym." Here are stories that chart the thorny relationships between genders, races, and friends, stories that break the rules and expose the turning points of life for what they really are.</p><p>John Edgar Wideman won the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1984 for Sent for You Yesterday and in 1990 for Philadelphia Fire. His second memoir, Fatheralong, was a finalist for the National Book Award. His most recent books are Hoop Roots and The Island: Martinique. He teaches at Brown University.Weight<br><br>My mother is a weightlifter. You know what I mean. She understands that the best-laid plans, the sweetest beginnings, have a way of turning to shit. Bad enough when life fattens you up just so it can turn around and gobble you down. Worse for the ones like my mother who life keeps skinny, munching on her daily, one cruel little needle-toothed bite at a time so the meal lasts and lasts. Mom understands life don&#x2019;t play so spends beaucoup time and energy getting ready for the worst. She lifts weights to stay strong. Not barbells or dumbbells, though most of the folks she deals with, especially her sons, act just that way, like dumbbells. No. The weights she lifts are burdens her children&#x2019;s, her neighbors, yours. Whatever awful calamities arrive on her doorstep or howl in the news, my mom squeezes her frail body beneath them. Grips, hoists, holds the weight. I swear sometimes I can hear her sinews squeaking and singing under a load of invisible tons.<br> I ought to know, since I&#x2019;m one of the burdens bowing her shoulders. She loves heavy, hopeless me unconditionally. Before I was born, Mom loved me, forever and ever till death do us part. I&#x2019;ll never be anyone else&#x2019;s darling, darling boy, so it&#x2019;s her fault, her doing, isn&#x2019;t it, that neither of us can face the thought of losing the other. How could I resist reciprocating her love. Needing her. Draining her. Feeling her straining underneath me, the pop and crackle of her arthritic joints, her gray hair sizzling with static electricity, the hissing friction, tension, and pressure as she lifts more than she can bear. Bears more than she can possibly lift. You have to see it to believe it. Like the Flying Wallendas or Houdini&#x2019;s spine-chilling escapes. One of the greatest shows on earth.<br> My mother believes in a god whose goodness would not permit him to inflict more troubles than a person can handle. A god of mercy and salvation. A sweaty, bleeding god presiding over a fitness class in which his chosen few punish their muscles. She should wear a T-shirt: God&#x2019;s Gym.<br> In spite of a son in prison for life, twin girls born dead, a mind- blown son who roams the streets with everything he owns in a shopping cart, a strung-out daughter with a crack baby, a good daughter who miscarried the only child her dry womb ever produced, in spite of me and the rest of my limpalong, near-to-normal siblings and their children my nephews doping and gangbanging, nieces unwed, underage, dropping babies as regularly as the seasons in spite of breast cancer, sugar diabetes, hypertension, failing kidneys, emphysema, gout, all resident in her body and epidemic in the community, knocking off one by one her girlhood friends, in spite of corrosive poverty and a neighborhood whose streets are no longer safe even for gray, crippled-up folks like her, my mom loves her god, thanks him for the blessings he bestows, keeps her faith he would not pile on more troubles than she could bear. Praises his name and prays for strength, prays for more weight so it won&#x2019;t fall on those around her less able to bear up.<br> You&#x2019;ve seen those iron-pumping, muscle-bound brothers fresh out the slam who show up at the playground to hoop and don&#x2019;t get picked on a team cause they can&#x2019;t play a lick, not before they did their bit, and sure not now, back on the set, stiff and stone-handed as Frankenstein, but finally some old head goes on and chooses one on his squad because the brother&#x2019;s so huge and scary-looking sitting there with his jaw tight, lip poked out, you don&#x2019;t want him freaking out and kicking everybody&#x2019;s ass just because the poor baby&#x2019;s feelings is hurt, you know what I mean, the kind so buff looks like his coiled-up insides about to bust through his skin or his skin&#x2019;s stripped clean off his body so he&#x2019;s a walking anatomy lesson. Well, that&#x2019;s how my mom looks to me sometimes, her skin peeled away, no secrets, every taut nerve string on display.<br> I can identify the precise moment when I began to marvel at my mother&#x2019;s prodigious strength, during a trip with her one afternoon to the supermarket on Walnut Street in Shadyside, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, white community with just a few families of us colored sprinkled at the bottom ends of a couple of streets. I was very young, young enough not to believe I&#x2019;d grow old, just bigger. A cashier lady who seemed to be acquainted with my mother asked very loudly, Is this your son, and Mom smiled in reply to the cashier&#x2019;s astonishment, saying calmly, Yes, he is, and the doughy white lady in her yellow Krogers smock with her name on the breast tried to match my mother&#x2019;s smile but only managed a fake grin like she&#x2019;d just discovered shit stinks but didn&#x2019;t want anybody else to know she knew. Then she blurted, He&#x2019;s a tall one, isn&#x2019;t he.<br> Not a particularly unusual moment as we unloaded our shopping cart and waited for the bad news to ring up on the reeeeegister. The three of us understood, in spite of the cashier&#x2019;s quick shuffle, what had seized her attention. In public situations the sight of my pale, Caucasian-featured mother and her variously colored kids disconcerted strangers. They gulped. Stared. Muttered insults. We were visible proof somebody was sneaking around after dark, breaking the apartheid rule, messy mulatto exceptions to the rule, trailing behind a woman who could be white.<br> Nothing special about the scene in Krogers. Just an ugly moment temporarily reprieved from turning uglier by the cashier&#x2019;s remark, which attributed her surprise to a discrepancy in height, not color. But the exchange alerted me to a startling fact I was taller than my mother. The brown boy, me, could look down at the crown of his light-skinned mother&#x2019;s head. Obsessed by size, like most adolescent boys, size in general and the size of each and every particular part of my body and how mine compared to others, I was always busily measuring and keeping score, but somehow I&#x2019;d lost track of my mother&#x2019;s size, and mine relative to hers. Maybe because she was beyond size. If someone had asked me my mother&#x2019;s height or weight, I probably would have replied, Huh. Ubiquitous, I might say now. A tiny skin- and-bone woman way too huge for size to pin down.<br> The moment in Krogers is also when I began to marvel at my mother&#x2019;s strength. Unaccountably, unbeknown to me, my body had grown larger than hers, yes, and the news was great in a way, but more striking and not so comforting was the fact that, never mind my advantage in size, I felt hopelessly weak standing there beside my mom in Krogers. A wimpy shadow next to her solid flesh and bones. I couldn&#x2019;t support for one hot minute a fraction of the weight she bore on her shoulders twenty-four hours a day. The weight of the cashier&#x2019;s big-mouthed disbelief. The weight of hating the pudgy white woman forever because she tried to steal my mother from me. The weight of cooking and cleaning and making do with no money, the weight of fighting and loving us iron-headed, ungrateful brats. Would I always feel puny and inadequate when I looked up at the giant fist hovering over our family, the fist of God or the Devil, ready to squash us like bugs if my mother wasn&#x2019;t always on duty, spreading herself thin as an umbrella over our heads, her bones its steel ribs keeping the sky from falling.<br> Reaching down for the brass handle of this box I must lift to my shoulder, I need the gripping strength of my mother&#x2019;s knobby-knuckled fingers, her superhero power to bear impossible weight.<br><br>Since I was reading her this story over the phone (I called it a story but Mom knew better), I stopped at the end of the paragraph above that you just completed, if you read that far, stopped because the call was long distance, daytime rates, and also because the rest had yet to be written. I could tell by her silence she was not pleased. Her negative reaction didn&#x2019;t surprise me. Plenty in the piece I didn&#x2019;t like either. Raw, stuttering stuff I intended to improve in subsequent drafts, but before revising and trying to complete it, I needed her blessing.<br> Mom&#x2019;s always been my best critic. I depend on her honesty. She tells the truth yet never affects the holier-than-thou superiority of some people who believe they occupy the high ground and let you know in no uncertain terms that you nor nobody else like you ain&#x2019;t hardly coming close. Huh-uh. My mother smiles as often as she groans or scolds when she hears gossip about somebody behaving badly. My, my, my, she&#x2019;ll say, and nod and smile and gently broom you, the sinner, and herself into the same crowded heap, no one any better than they should be, could be, absolute equals in a mellow sputter of laughter she sometimes can&#x2019;t suppress, hiding it, muffling it with her fist over her mouth, nodding, remembering how people&#x2019;s badness can be too good to be true, My, my, my.<br> Well, my story didn&#x2019;t tease out a hint of laugh, and forget the 550 miles separating us, I could tell she wasn&#x2019;t smiling either. Why was she holding back the sunshine that could forgive the worst foolishness. Absolve my sins. Retrieve me from the dead-end corners into which I paint myself. Mama, please. Please, please, please, don&#x2019;t you weep. And tell ole Martha not to moan. Don&#x2019;t leave me drowning like Willie Boy in the deep blue sea. Smile, Mom. Laugh. Send that healing warmth through the wire and save poor me.<br> Was it the weightlifting joke, Mom. Maybe you didn&#x2019;t think it was funny.<br> Sorry. Tell the truth, I didn&#x2019;t see nothing humorous about any of it. God&#x2019;s T-shirt. You know better. Ought to be ashamed of yourself. Taking the Lord&#x2019;s name in vain.<br> Where do you get such ideas, boy. I think I know my children. God knows I should by now, shouldn&#x2019;t I. How am I not supposed to know you- all after all you&#x2019;ve put me through beating my brains out to get through to you. Yes, yes, yes. Then one you-all goes and does something terrible I never would have guessed was in you. Won&#x2019;t say you break my heart. Heart&#x2019;s been broke too many times. In so many little itty-bitty pieces can&#x2019;t break down no more, but you-all sure ain&#x2019;t finished with me, are you. Still got some new trick in you to lay on your weary mother before she leaves here.<br> Guess I ought to be grateful to God an old fool like me&#x2019;s still around to be tricked. Weightlifter. Well, it&#x2019;s different. Nobody ain&#x2019;t called me nothing like weightlifter before. It&#x2019;s different, sure enough.<br> Now here&#x2019;s where she should have laughed. She&#x2019;d picked up the stone I&#x2019;d bull&#x2019;s-eyed right into the middle of her wrinkled brow, between her tender, brown, all-seeing eyes, lifted it and turned it over in her hands like a jeweler with a tiny telescope strapped to his skull inspecting a jewel, testing its heft and brilliance, the marks of God&#x2019;s hands, God&#x2019;s will, the hidden truths sparkling in its depths, multiplied, splintered through mirroring facets. After such a brow-scrunching examination, isn&#x2019;t it time to smile. Kiss and make up. Wasn&#x2019;t that Mom&#x2019;s way. Wasn&#x2019;t that how she handled the things that hurt us and hurt her. Didn&#x2019;t she ease the pain of our worst injuries with the balm of her everything&#x2019;s-going-to-be-all-right-in-the-morning smile. The smile that takes the weight, every hurtful ounce, and forgives, the smile licking our wounds so they scab over and she can pick them off our skin, stuff their lead weight into the bulging sack of all sorrows slung across her back.<br> The possibility that my wannabe story had actually hurt her dawned on me. Or should I say bopped me upside my head like the Br&#x2019;er Bear club my middle brother loads in his cart to discourage bandits. I wished I was sitting at the kitchen table across from her so I could check for damage, her first, then check myself in the mirror of those soft, brown, incredibly loving mother&#x2019;s eyes. If I&#x2019;d hurt her even a teeny-tiny bit, I&#x2019;d be broken forever unless those eyes repaired me. Yet even as I regretted reading her the clumsy passage and prepared myself to surrender wholly, happily to the hounds of hell if I&#x2019;d harmed one hair on her frail gray head, I couldn&#x2019;t deny a sneaky, smarting tingle of satisfaction at the thought that maybe, maybe words I&#x2019;d written had touched another human being, mama mia or not.<br> Smile, Mom. It&#x2019;s just a story. Just a start. I know it needs more work. You were supposed to smile at the weightlifting part.<br> God not something to joke about.<br> C&#x2019;mon, Mom. How many times have I heard Reverend Fitch cracking you up with his corny God jokes.<br> Time and a place.<br> Maybe stories are my time and place, Mom. You know. My time and place to say things I need to say.<br> No matter how bad it comes out sounding, right. No matter you make a joke of your poor mother . . .<br> Poor mother&#x2019;s suffering. You were going to say, Poor mother&#x2019;s suffering, weren&#x2019;t you.<br> You heard what I said.<br> And heard what you didn&#x2019;t say. I hear those words too. The unsaid ones, Mom. Louder sometimes. Drowning out what gets said, Mom.<br> Whoa. We gon let it all hang out this morning, ain&#x2019;t we, son. First that story. Now you accusing me of your favorite trick, that muttering under your breath. Testing me this morning, aren&#x2019;t you. What makes you think a sane person would ever pray for more weight. Ain&#x2019;t those the words you put in my mouth. More weight.<br> And the building shook. The earth rumbled. More weight descended like God&#x2019;s fist on his Hebrew children. Like in Lamentations. The book in the Bible. The movie based on the book based on what else, the legend of my mother&#x2019;s longsuffering back.<br> Because she had a point.<br> People with no children can be cruel. Had I heard it first from Oprah, the diva of suffering my mother could have become if she&#x2019;d pursued show biz instead of weightlifting. Or was the damning phrase a line from one of Gwen Brooks&#x2019;s abortion blues. Whatever their source, the words fit, and I was ashamed. I do know better. A bachelor and nobody&#x2019;s daddy, but still my words have weight. Like sticks and stones, words can break bones. Metaphors can pull you apart and put you back together all wrong. I know what you mean, Mom. My entire life I&#x2019;ve had to listen to people trying to tell me I&#x2019;m just a white man in a dark skin.<br> Give me a metaphor long enough and I&#x2019;ll move the earth. Somebody famous said it. Or said something like that. And everybody, famous or not, knows words sting. Words change things. Step on a crack, break your mother&#x2019;s back.<br> On the other hand, Mom, metaphor&#x2019;s just my way of trying to say two things, be in two places at once. Saying goodbye and hello and goodbye. Many things, many places at once. You know, like James Cleveland singing our favorite gospel tune, I Stood on the Banks of the Jordan.&#x201d; Metaphors are very short songs. Mini-mini-stories. Rivers between, like the Jordan where ships sail on, sail on and you stand and wave goodbye- hello, hello-goodbye.<br> Weightlifter just a word, just play. I was only teasing, Mom. I didn&#x2019;t mean to upset you. I certainly intended no harm. I&#x2019;d swallow every stick of dynamite it takes to pay for a Nobel prize before I&#x2019;d accept one if it cost just one of your soft, curly hairs.<br> Smile. Let&#x2019;s begin again.<br><br>It&#x2019;s snowing in Massachusetts / The ground&#x2019;s white in O-hi-o. Yes, it&#x2019;s snowing in Massachusetts / And ground&#x2019;s white in O-hi-o. Shut my eyes, Mr. Weatherman / Can&#x2019;t stand to see my baby go.<br><br>When I called you last Thursday evening and didn&#x2019;t get an answer I started worrying. I didn&#x2019;t know why. We&#x2019;d talked Tuesday and you sounded fine. Better than fine. A lift and lilt in your voice. After I hung up the phone Tuesday, said to myself, Mom&#x2019;s in good shape. Beat-up but her spirit&#x2019;s strong. Said those very words to myself more than once Tuesday. Beat-up but her spirit&#x2019;s strong. The perkiness I sensed in you helped make my Wednesday super. Early rise. Straight to my desk. Two pages before noon and you know me, Mom. Two pages can take a week, a month. I&#x2019;ve had two- page years. I&#x2019;ve had decades dreaming the one perfec...</p><h2>At the edge of history</h2><p>Seminal works of cultural history that changed the way we think about ourselves.</p><p></p><h2>Only Words</h2><p>When is rape not a crime? When it's pornography--or so First Amendment law seems to say: in film, a rape becomes "free speech." Pornography, Catharine MacKinnon contends, is neither speech nor free. Pornography, racial and sexual harassment, and hate speech are acts of intimidation, subordination, terrorism, and discrimination, and should be legally treated as such. <i>Only Words</i> is a powerful indictment of a legal system at odds with itself, its First Amendment promoting the very inequalities its Fourteenth Amendment is supposed to end. In the bold and compelling style that has made her one of our most provocative legal critics, MacKinnon depicts a society caught in a vicious hypocrisy. Words that offer bribes or fix prices or segregate facilities are treated by law as acts, but words and pictures that victimize and target on the basis of race and sex are not. Pornography--an act of sexual domination reproduced in the viewing--is protected by law in the name of "the free and open exchange of ideas." But the proper concern of law, MacKinnon says, is not what speech says, but what it does. What the "speech" of pornography and of racial and sexual harassment and hate propaganda does is promote and enact the power of one social group over another. Cutting with surgical deftness through cases of harassment in the workplace and on college campuses, through First Amendment cases involving Nazis, Klansmen, and pornographers, MacKinnon shows that as long as discriminatory practices are protected as free speech, equality will be only a word.</p><p>Catharine A.

Invaluable descriptions of African tribal rituals concerning birth, marriage and death, and of tribal fetishism, ritual murder, cannibalism, exotic sexual practices, more. Preface. 1 illustration. 1 foldout map.<br></p><p>Sir Richard Burton's Wanderings in West Africa is a rare book. There are not many narratives that deal with the West Africa of the 19th century, especially in so much detail. Written a few years after the famous journey Burton describes in Lake Regions of Central Africa, this book takes the reader on a port-by-port tour from Liverpool to Morocco and then as far south as Fernando Po (Equatorial Guinea). Like Burton's other books, this one contains a wealth of information on subjects as varied as costume, language, agriculture, colonial administration, and local religions and rulers. There is certainly something in these volumes to interest any enthusiast of African history, or of colonial attitudes, as Burton is certainly free with his opinion on everything. <p>This narrative demonstrates Burton's typical scorn for all the people he encounters. For example, he is able to simultaneously exhibit contempt for the customs of the Africans and the English, who both treat young women like show dogs: </p><p>"When marriageable, [girls] are taken home, kept from work, highly fed, well dressed, and profusely ornamented. After many ceremonies, they are exhibited in the town by the advertisements of finery, dancing, and playing; thus it is pretty much the same in barbarous Medidsiasikpong (Africa) as in civilised England." </p><p>However, the darker his subjects' skin, the more offensive Burton's commentary becomes, and it is sometimes really shocking: </p><p>"From humbly aspiring to be owned as a man, our black friend now boldly advances his claims to egalit� and fraternit�, as if there could be brotherhood between the crown and the clown! The being who `invents nothing originates nothing, improves nothing, who can only cook, nurse and fiddle;' who has neither energy nor industry...the self-constituted thrall, that delights in subjection to and in imitation of the superior races." </p><p>The real interest in the book is its incredibly detailed descriptions of the things Burton sees as he wanders. He makes everything his business, from circumcision rites to dietary preferences. For example, his description of the kola nut is a wealth of sensory and cultural information: </p><p>"The Shaykh then presented me with a handful of kola nuts, which...are the local 'chaw'...The edible parts are the five or six beans, which are compared to Brazil nuts; they are covered with a pure white placenta, which must be removed with the finger-nails, and then appears the rosy pink skin...Travellers use it to quiet the sensation of hunger...In native courts eating kola nuts forms part of the ceremony of welcoming strangers, and the Yorubas have a proverb: 'Anger draweth arrows from the quiver: good words draw kolas from the bag.'" </p><p>Only Richard Burton could create such a combination of immediate experience, botanical knowledge, practical advice, and folklore in one paragraph. That is the kind of writer, and the kind of man he was - equally brilliant and opinionated in many different fields.</p></p><h2>JOYCE IN HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS: ESSAYS</h2><p>This volume collects the best essays from the 1992 International James Joyce Symposium held in Dublin, which had as its title "In the Heart of the Hibernian Metropolis." Dublin, of course, has special attraction for Joyceans as both the source and subject matter of Joyce's genius, but the essays reproduced here reflect - like the symposium itself - the newest and most exciting trends in Joyce scholarship from around the world.<br>The volume includes an introductory essay by the president of the Republic of Ireland, Mary Robinson. The thirty essays that follow were selected from those delivered at nearly 120 different sessions. Faced with so many possibilities, the editors have produced a book that reflects the flavor and intellectual range of the world of Joyce studies as we head toward the end of the century - Joyce's century.<br>The inclusions range from major addresses to essays on topics as diverse as Joyce and race, elements of imagery in Joyce's works, the Joyce papers of the National Library, Joyce and cinema, Joyce's reputation (including examinations of attacks on his work), Joyce's relationships with other writers, Leopold Bloom and being Jewish in Ireland, Joyce and feminism, musical elements in Joyce's works, Joyce and commodity culture, Finnegans Wake and sexuality, Joyce and homosexuality, Joyce's narrative strategies, and various theoretical questions. This collection is a vital contribution to Joycean scholarship and will be of great interest to critics, teachers, and students of James Joyce, as well as those interested in modern literature, Irish studies, and critical theory.</p><p>Morris Beja, professor emeritus of English at Ohio State University, is the author or coauthor of many books on Joyce and other modernists, including Twenty-First Joyce.<br><br>David Norris has been teaching at Nottingham University for more than 20 years.</p><h2>Wyoming Atlas (Wyoming Atlas &amp; Gazetteer)</h2><p>Wouldn't it be nice to always have exactly the right kind of map, whatever your needs may be?

In <i>The Thirteen American Arguments</i>, Howard Fineman lifts readers above the fog of modern politics . . . and offers a unique vantage point from which to see that the debates that shape American politics are timeless and profound.&#x201d;</b> --<i>The Washingtonian<br></i><br>Howard Fineman is one of our best-known and most trusted political journalists. Mixing vivid scenes and figures from the campaign trail with forays into four hundred years of American history, Fineman shows that every debate, from our nation&#x2019;s founding to the present day, is rooted in one of thirteen arguments that&#x2013;thankfully&#x2013;defy resolution. It is the very process of never-ending argument, Fineman explains, that defines us, inspires us, and keeps us free. At a time when most public disagreement seems shrill and meaningless, Fineman makes a cogent case for nurturing the real American dialogue. <br><br>Shouting is not arguing, Fineman notes, but often hot-button topics, media &#x201c;cross-fires,&#x201d; and blogs reflect the deepest currents in American life. In an enlightening book that cuts through the din and makes sense of the headlines, Fineman captures the essential issues that have always compelled healthy and heated debate&#x2013;and must continue to do so in order for us to prosper in the twenty-first century. <i>The Thirteen American Arguments</i> run the gamut, from issues of individual identity to our country&#x2019;s role in the world, including:<br><br><b>� Who is a Person?</b> The Declaration of Independence says &#x201c;everyone,&#x201d; but it took a Civil War and the Civil Rights and other movements to make that a reality. Presently, what about human embryos and &#x201c;unlawful enemy combatants?&#x201d;<br><b>� Who is an American? </b>Only a nation of immigrants could argue so much about who should become one. There is currently added urgency when terrorists are at large in the world and twelve million &#x201c;undocumented&#x201d; aliens are in the country.<br><b>� The Role of Faith. </b>No country is more legally secular yet more avowedly prayerful. From Thomas Jefferson to Terri Schiavo, we can never quite decide where God fits in government.<br><b>� Presidential Power. </b>In a democracy, leadership is all the more difficult &#x2014; and, paradoxically, all the more essential. From George Washington to George W. Bush, we have always asked: How much power should a president have?<br><b>� America in the World.</b> Uniquely, we perpetually ask ourselves whether we have a moral obligation to change the world &#x2014; or, alternatively, whether we must try to change it to survive in it.<br><br>Whether it&#x2019;s the environment, international trade, interpreting law, Congress vs. the president, or reformers vs. elites, these are the issues that galvanized the Founding Fathers and should still inspire our leaders, thinkers, and citizens. If we cease to argue about these things, we cease to be. &#x201c;Argument is strength, not weakness,&#x201d; says Fineman. &#x201c;As long as we argue, there is hope, and as long as there is hope, we will argue.&#x201d;<br><br>Praise for <i>The Thirteen American Arguments</i><br>&#x201c;A spectacular feat, a profound book about America that moves with ease from history to recent events. A talented storyteller, Howard Fineman provides a human face to each of the core political arguments that have alternately separated, strengthened, and sustained us from our founding to the present day.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of <i>Team of Rivals</i><br><br>&#x201c;With a marvelous command of the past and a keen grasp of the present, Howard Fineman expertly details one of the great truths about our country: that we are a nation built on arguments, and our capacity to summon what Lincoln called &#x2018;the better angels of our nature&#x2019; lies in undertaking those debates with civility and mutual respect. Few people understand politics as well as Fineman does, and this work is an indispensable guide not only to the battles of the moment, but to the wars that will go on long after this news cycle is long forgotten.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Jon Meacham, author of <i>Franklin and Winston</i><br><br>&#x201c;In an impressively thought-provoking original approach, Fineman revisits the great defining arguments that will deepen your understanding of America.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Newt Gingrich, author of <i>Real Change: From the World That Fails to the World That Works<br></i><br>&#x201c;Howard Fineman proves that few things are as compelling as a well-argued debate. This book offers a thought-provoking way to look at America, its history, and our evolving public discourse.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Arianna Huffington, author of <i>Right Is Wrong</i><br><br>&#x201c;A perfect antidote to the old horse-race political journalism&#x2013;a timely (and timeless) reminder of what&#x2019;s really at stake in the race for the presidency.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Jeffrey Toobin, author of <i>The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court</i><br><br>&#x201c;Howard Fineman guides the reader through the controversies that have haunted this nation since its inception. In the process he creates a fresh context for making sense of the 2008 campaign. Both scholars and students of politics can learn much from this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Kathleen Hall Jamieson, co-author of <i>unSpun: Finding Facts in a World of Disinformation</i><br><br>&#x201c;A stimulating book that should be read by anyone who cares about the idea and arguments that made this country great, and which are critical to our future direction.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;David Boies, author of <i>Courting Justice</i><br><br>"America is &#x201c;The Arguing Country, born in, and born to, debate,&#x201d; claims veteran journalist Fineman in this<br>brisk look at 13 debates that have driven (and riven) the nation from its inception, and continue to do so<br>today. Arising from fundamental questions like &#x201c;Who is a person?&#x201d; or &#x201c;What can we know and say?&#x201d; or<br>&#x201c;What does it mean to pursue a more perfect union?&#x201d; these 13 debates are perennial, undergirding each of<br>the nation&#x2019;s political controversies, and they are constitutive, defining nothing less than America&#x2019;s national identity. If American political discourse frequently runs hot, it is because Americans are as passionate<br>about these fundamental questions as they are different in their answers. Knowing that Fineman is an<br>occasional guest on MSNBC&#x2019;s Hardball, it is perhaps tempting to read this book as a particularly eloquent<br>and historically informed apologia for the fiery point-counterpoint duels often seen on cable news<br>channels. Yet Fineman openly acknowledges that the media sometimes hinders open debate, and it would<br>be more accurate to describe Fineman&#x2019;s work as itself an argument, urging perspective and optimism amid today&#x2019;s overheated debates."&#x2013;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>Howard Fineman is <i>Newsweek&#x2019;s</i> senior Washington correspondent and columnist.

Nashville is home to the abstemious souls<br>of the Southern Baptist Convention, but also to country singers keening<br>over lives ruined by drink and dissolution. In 1925 the mountains of east<br>Tennessee were the site of the infamous Scopes Trial, in which a teacher<br>was sent to jail for teaching the science of biological evolution. Yet those<br>same rugged mountains are home to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,<br>a leading center for advanced science, and to two nuclear power plants<br>that operate on the physics venerated there.<br><br>So Tennessee was the appropriate launching pad for the political career<br>of Senator William Frist, M.D.&#x2013;and also the appropriate place for it to<br>crash to Earth. In Tennessee, the senator had to fly through the crosswinds<br>of cultural conflict, between the theories and demands of Bible Belt religion<br>and of ivory tower science. The bumpy ride ultimately reduced his image<br>from that of an idealistic, <i>Grey&#x2019;s Anatomy&#x2014;</i>style &#x201c;superdoc&#x201d; and presidential<br>possibility to a hopeless political hack. The trajectory of his public life illuminated<br>the power of an essential American Argument. We are a prayerful,<br>Bible-believing country, yet that same trait causes us to constantly<br>fret&#x2013;and argue&#x2013;over the extent to which our faith should influence decisions<br>about education, research, welfare, and other government activities.<br><br>Frist rose to prominence on the secular, science side of the argument.<br>His first calling card was medicine. His father and uncle were prominent<br>Nashville physicians who had made a fortune assembling one of the nation&#x2019;s<br>first HMOs. He was a brilliant, meticulous student, excelling at<br>Princeton, at Harvard Medical School, and in internships at Massachusetts<br>General Hospital.<br><br>Frist had a need to exhibit his knowledge in dramatic circumstances.<br>He became a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon famous for steely nerves<br>and clinical derring-do, &#x201c;cracking open chests,&#x201d; as he put it, thrusting his<br>hands into thoraxes to remove diseased hearts and lungs. He owned a<br>plane, which he kept gassed up and ready to fly so he could ferry in replacement<br>parts&#x2013;living hearts&#x2013;for his patients. He piloted the plane, of<br>course. He was forever experimenting with new surgical techniques,<br>studying logistics, puzzling over the social consequences of the on-the-fly<br>triage necessary to match salvageable patients with salvageable hearts. A<br>committed runner, lean as a whippet, and blessed with an ability to concentrate<br>in an operating theater, Frist slept only three or four hours a night.<br><br>He used the wee hours to educate himself by writing medical tracts.<br>As he launched his campaign for the Senate in 1994, his religious faith<br>was not a visible part of his public profile. He rarely talked about his<br>standard-issue Presbyterianism, the denomination of choice among the<br>Southern business establishment. Rather, he advertised the healing power<br>of medicine. On the wall behind his desk, he tacked up a picture of a picnic<br>he had organized and attended earlier that year. He was surrounded<br>in the photo by a cheerful-looking throng of more than one hundred.<br>Who were they? &#x201c;Those are my former transplant patients,&#x201d; Frist said<br>proudly. &#x201c;I feel a deep bond with those people,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t express it<br>in words.&#x201d;<br><br>Even after he became a senator, Frist did not abandon his medical pursuits.<br>He was an unofficial doctor-in-residence in the Capitol. After the<br>9/11 terrorist attacks, he used his late-night study vigils to produce a<br>picture-and-text guide and instruction manual on how to treat injuries<br>and contaminations that might follow a chemical or biological assault. He<br>insisted that his full title be emblazoned on press releases and in brass on<br>his office door: Senator William Frist, M.D.<br><br>When he began fashioning his political career, Frist had little contact<br>with the Other Tennessee, the one controlled, or at least defined, by the<br>Southern Baptists. The state&#x2019;s largest denomination, they had always set<br>the tone politically, but not always directly. In pioneer days they were a<br>liberating political force, opposed to hierarchical authority, especially an<br>&#x201c;established&#x201d; church, of any kind. They promoted democratic ideals by<br>insisting that man had free will, and by insisting that the route to salvation<br>lay in the simple, straightforward act of reading and believing the<br>Bible. Baptists had grown mighty on America&#x2019;s frontiers, where settlers<br>had needed a portable, independent faith, one that validated their sense of<br>freedom but also gave them confidence that they were doing the Lord&#x2019;s<br>work in the New World.<br><br>At first, Baptists and their brethren wanted nothing to do with direct<br>involvement in government, however, which they tended to fear (given<br>their history in Europe and in much of colonial America) as an instrument<br>of theological oppression. That attitude changed somewhat in the<br>1920s, as rural Americans came to feel themselves under assault by a new,<br>metropolitan modernity. The battle was joined in Dayton, Tennessee,<br>where a teacher named John Scopes was brought to trial for violating a<br>state law against the teaching of evolution. Clarence Darrow, the most famous<br>courtroom lawyer of his day, teamed up with an equally famous<br>journalist, H. L. Mencken, to make a national laughingstock out of the<br>law&#x2019;s chief defender, William Jennings Bryan, the &#x201c;prairie populist.&#x201d;<br>And yet it was Bryan&#x2019;s side&#x2013;the Bible-believing one&#x2013;that won the<br>case at trial and on appeal. In New York City, textbook authors were<br>forced to delete evolution from their newest manuscripts. The Tennessee<br>law remained on the books, banning instruction in &#x201c;any theory that denies<br>the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible&#x201d; or that<br>suggests &#x201c;man has descended from a lower order of animals.&#x201d; Similar<br>laws existed in fourteen other states until the U.S. Supreme Court, in<br>1968, firmly and finally ruled that they were an unconstitutional imposition<br>of sectarian dogma in secular classrooms.<br><br>The national ridicule engendered by the Scopes Trial drove two generations<br>of Baptists out of the political arena. Despite their legal early<br>&#x201c;victory,&#x201d; the Southern Baptist leaders increasingly downplayed fundamentalist<br>teachings, even if their congregants did not.<br><br>But by the time Frist was thinking of running for office, a new generation<br>of hard-liners&#x2013;more media-savvy and sophisticated, but no less dedicated<br>to Scripture&#x2013;had reasserted control of the denomination. Luckily<br>for Frist (at least it seemed lucky at the time) the Baptists&#x2019; leading political<br>figure in the early 1990s was Dr. Richard Land, who had close ties to Karl<br>Rove, an ally of the late Lee Atwater&#x2019;s and the emerging kingmaker of the<br>Southern-based Republican Party. Land headed the Southern Baptists&#x2019; political<br>and grassroots organizing arm. He was theologically devout, but<br>had a doctorate from Oxford and enjoyed jousting with the Other Side.<br>And maybe the Lord had a hand in bringing him to the campaign: Like<br>Frist, Land was a Princeton man. He could educate Frist in the political<br>ways of the Word.<br><br>It was a slow, careful process. In Frist&#x2019;s first campaign, in 1994, Land<br>did not press his fellow Princetonian on faith issues. It wasn&#x2019;t part of the<br>GOP&#x2019;s national game plan. Instead, the Republicans ran coast-to-coast on<br>Newt Gingrich&#x2019;s determinedly secular &#x201c;Contract with America,&#x201d; which<br>studiously avoided social and theological issues and instead focused on<br>anti-Washington themes: tax cuts, spending reform, and the iniquity of<br>the new Clinton administration and the Democrats who had ruled the<br>House of Representatives for forty years. Frist was anti-abortion&#x2013;just<br>about everybody in the new GOP was&#x2013;but otherwise had felt little need<br>to talk much about &#x201c;the social issues.&#x201d;<br><br>Frist&#x2019;s focus changed once he arrived in Washington, especially after<br>George Bush became president, the GOP took control of the Senate, and<br>Frist, with a behind-the-scenes boost from the White House, became majority<br>leader. Suddenly he was the man in the middle of an American Argument.<br>Stem-cell research was the specific issue. Baptists and other<br>fundamentalists joined with the Vatican hierarchy to oppose the use of<br>human embryos in such research, even though many frozen embryos<br>were being discarded by fertility clinics and most scientists thought research<br>using cells from that source held great clinical promise in the<br>search for cures to disease.<br><br>Frist proceeded to ambush himself on the issue. In 2001, he supported<br>the president&#x2019;s decision to limit federally funded research to cultures from<br>existing embryo &#x201c;lines.&#x201d; But under pressure from his erstwhile colleagues<br>in the medical community&#x2013;not to mention former first lady Nancy Reagan,<br>who saw stem-cell research as the route to a cure for Alzheimer&#x2019;s<br>disease&#x2013;Frist reversed course. Now, he said, he considered the existing<br>&#x201c;lines&#x201d; inadequate, and would support the use of embryos that would otherwise<br>be discarded by clinics and perhaps other sources as well. Since he<br>was a doctor and potential presidential candidate, Frist&#x2019;s 2005 switch was<br>major national news. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an earthqu...</p><h2>My Wonderful Christmas Tree</h2><p>Looking out her window on Christmas Eve, the author introduces the numbers from one to twelve as she spies several animals nestled in the boughs of an evergreen tree</p><p><p>Classic northwoods tale and signature art from the great Dahlov Ipcar.</p>Dahlov Ipcar has written thirty books for children.</p><h2>Historical Atlas of Religion in America</h2><p>Historical Atlas of Religion in America [hardcover] Edwin Scott Gaustad [Jan 01, 1976]</p><p></p><h2>How Your Horse Moves: A Unique Visual Guide to Improving Performance</h2><p>Understand how bones and muscles work together to produce movement by seeing the musculoskeletal system painted on a real equine canvasDiscover how correct riding and training can bring out the best in your horse ? increasing fitness, strength and balance ? by seeing exactly what happens as he movesPractical exercises and stretches demonstrate how you can improve suppleness, reduce the risk of injury, gain confidence and develop a deeper rapport with your horseThis unique ?inside-out? view of how the horse uses its body is presented in a graphic, easy-to-follow way to aid in improving all aspects of riding and training.

The boy who would become Magneto is Max Eisenhardt, smart and athletic, living with his family in Germany in 1935. He watches in horror as the Germans invade Poland, prompting his family to flee; he sees them killed, like thousands of others; he takes his place as a worker in a concentration camp. But all the while, it nags at him that he should be fighting back, and his father's admonition to wait for the moment, a time when everything lines up, when anything is possible, when suddenly you can make things happen rings in his head, as does the face of the girl he has always loved, a girl who has ended up in a Gypsy camp, fated for extermination. This is an inherently powerful story, handled with grace and care, delivered in a haunting, painterly style&#x2014;and filled with historical information and context. Extensive back pages include a teacher's guide to using this series in the classroom. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet each island, as if built on shifting sands and eroded and reshaped by a universal sea, was re-forming itself, or was being remolded, was expanding its horizons or sinking under the rising waters of a cultural global warming. It was a journey between worlds, worlds fragiley conjoined by a river both ominous and luminescent, muscular and bosomy, harsh and sensuous. <br></i><br>From windswept plateaus to the South China Sea, the Mekong flows for three thousand miles, snaking its way through Southeast Asia. Long fascinated with this part of the world, former <i>New York Times </i>correspondent Edward Gargan embarked on an ambitious exploration of the Mekong and those living within its watershed. <b>The River&#x2019;s Tale</b> is a rare and profound book that delivers more than a correspondent&#x2019;s account of a place. It is a seminal examination of the Mekong and its people, a testament to the their struggles, their defeats and their victories.</p><p>"The Mekong scours some of the saddest history of recent years," writes Edward A. Gargan in this richly described and melancholic tale of his journey through Tibet, China, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Thirty years after landing in jail for refusing to register for the draft, the war-protester-turned-foreign-correspondent decided to see for himself how these countries have brought themselves back from the brink, and how their myriad cultures are struggling to preserve themselves. Beginning at the source of the Mekong River, near a camp of nomads high on the Tibetan plateau, he followed the 3,000 mile-long waterway through the heart of some of Asia's most complex and wounded societies. While the first half of Gargan's story, which focuses on China's demolition of Tibetan and other minority cultures, is interesting, it becomes gripping in the claustrophobic paranoia of Laos and post-Pol Pot Cambodia. Ultimately it becomes clear that while America lost the war in Vietnam, it has never left the region--lingering in the scars of war and inversely the creeping acceptance, if not embrace, of all things American. <i>--Lesley Reed</i>&#x201c;Far more than a picturesque personal travel diary. . .[Gargan] tells a unique and thought-provoking story.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Gargan&#x2019;s handling of the complex histories of the countries, tribes, regions and peoples touched by this great river is just right.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch<br></i> <br>&#x201c;Gargan has crafted a fine account of a very engaging journey. . . .

On their New Hampshire hill farm, she and her husband have cleared woodland for pasture, tended livestock, made maple syrup from their own trees. Kumin takes us into the woods for a spring mushroom hunt, tells about raising an orphan foal and explains how humans get involved with horses. There is an appreciative essay on the mule (and that beast's metaphorical connection with poets), another on Highland cattle. Seeing friends depart for a canoe trip evokes a comparison with Thoreau's journey to the Maine woods. Kumin also discusses her poetry and provides the story behind two specific poems. Her country essays are captivating; horse lovers and readers who appreciate Annie Dillard's meditations on nature will enjoy every word. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.From a hillside farm in New Hampshire, a talented and perceptive Pulitzer Prize-winning poet records the sprawl and benevolence of nature with intelligence, humor, and tenacity of spirit. These essays are for the most part in love with horses and other equines, but they also praise country kitchens, varieties of wild mushrooms, sugar maples, and hard work. They are a lively record of country life, connecting its intricacies and wonders to more reflective speculations on human presence and creativity. In one inventive essay, the virtues of mules are surveyed and extolled, and a witty analogy is drawn between them and poets. Overall, both the stability and vicissitudes of country life are set down, revealing an unpretentious, varied, and hearty livelihood. Recommended. Carol J. Lichtenberg, Washington State Univ.

Suddenly an iceberg tore the ship asunder and five lifeboats were lowered. As four lifeboats drifted into the fog and icy water, never to be heard from again, the last boat wrenched away from the sinking ship with a few blankets, some water and biscuits, and thirteen souls. Only one would survive. This is his story.<br><br>As they started their nine days adrift more than four hundred miles off Newfoundland, the castaways--an Irish couple and their two boys, an English woman and her daughter, newlyweds from Ireland, and several crewmen, including Thomas W. Nye from Fairhaven, Massachusetts--began fighting over food and water. One by one, though, day by day, they died. Some from exposure, others from madness and panic. In the end, only Nye and the ship's log survived.<br><br>Using Nye's firsthand descriptions and later newspaper accounts, ship's logs, assorted diaries, and family archives, Brian Murphy chronicles the horrific nine days that thirteen people suffered adrift on the cold gray Atlantic. <i>Adrift </i>brings readers to the edge of human limits, where every frantic decision and desperate act is a potential life saver or life taker.<br></p><p><b>Brian Murphy</b> is a journalist at <i>The Washington Post</i>.

Murphy and Vlahou perform a literary magic trick of sorts, transporting readers into another era and enabling them to see and feel what it was like to travel across the ice-choked north Atlantic in the depths of winter, and confront the ultimate nightmare scenario--a sinking ship in the middle of the ocean with no help in sight. <i>Adrift </i>is a chilling and searingly memorable tale of unimaginable suffering and one man's bittersweet triumph over the odds."--<b>Eric Jay Dolin</b>, author of <i>Black Flags, Blue Waters</i> and <i>Leviathan</i><br>"Ice is a killer. It kills ships and it kills the men and women on them. Brian Murphy reminds us that for every famous ship that goes down--think <i>Titanic</i>--countless thousands of others have been lost at sea, nameless, forgotten. In <i>Adrift</i> he brings back to life the story of the <i>John Rutledge</i>, and of the crusty Yankee sailors and seasick Irish immigrants who were aboard, and who died when the three-master foundered in the lonely, iceberg-studded North Atlantic--all but one man, that is, Thomas Nye, who kept his wits about him in a frigid open lifeboat and, half-frozen, clung to life.

Cronin is a remarkable storyteller (just ask adoring fans of his award-winning <em>Mary and O'Neil</em>), whose gorgeous writing brings depth and vitality to this ambitious epic about a virus that nearly destroys the world, and a six-year-old girl who holds the key to bringing it back. <em>The Passage</em> takes readers on a journey from the early days of the virus to the aftermath of the destruction, where packs of hungry infected scour the razed, charred cities looking for food, and the survivors eke out a bleak, brutal existence shadowed by fear. Cronin doesn't shy away from identifying his "virals" as vampires. But, these are not sexy, angsty vampires (you won&#x2019;t be seeing "Team Babcock" t-shirts any time soon), and they are not old-school, evil Nosferatus, either. These are a creation all Cronin's own--hairless, insectile, glow-in-the-dark mutations who are inextricably linked to their makers and the one girl who could destroy them all. A huge departure from Cronin's first two novels, <em>The Passage</em> is a grand mashup of literary and supernatural, a stunning beginning to a trilogy that is sure to dazzle readers of both genres. --<em>Daphne Durham</em></p> <strong>Dan Chaon Reviews <em>The Passage</em></strong> <p><b>Dan Chaon is the acclaimed author of the national bestseller <em>Await Your Reply</em> and <em>You Remind Me of Me</em>, which was named one of the best books of the year by <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em>, and <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>, among other publications. Chaon lives in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and teaches at Oberlin College. Read his review of <em>The Passage</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>There is a particular kind of reading experience--the feeling you get when you can&#x2019;t wait to find out what happens next, you can&#x2019;t turn the pages fast enough, and yet at the same time you are so engaged in the world of the story and the characters, you don&#x2019;t want it to end. It&#x2019;s a rare and complex feeling--that plot urgency pulling you forward, that yearning for more holding you back. We say that we are swept up, that we are taken away. Perhaps this effect is one of the true magic tricks that literature can offer to us, and yet it doesn&#x2019;t happen very often. Mostly, I think, we remember this experience from a few of the beloved books of our childhood.</p> <p>About three-quarters of the way through <em>The Passage</em>, I found myself in the grip of that peculiar and intense readerly emotion. One part of my brain couldn&#x2019;t wait to get to the next big revelation, and I found myself wanting to leapfrog from paragraph to paragraph, hurtling toward each looming climax. Meanwhile, another part of my brain was watching the dwindling final pages with dread, knowing that things would be over soon, and wishing to linger with each sentence and character a little while longer.</p> <p>Finishing <em>The Passage</em> for the first time, I didn&#x2019;t bother to put it on a shelf, because I knew I would be flipping back through its pages again the next day. Rereading. Considering. </p> <p>Certain kinds of books draw us into the lives of their characters, into their inner thoughts, to the extent that we seem to know them, as well as we know real people. Readers of Justin Cronin&#x2019;s earlier books, <em>Mary and O&#x2019;Neil</em> and <em>The Summer Guest</em>, will recognize him as an extraordinarily insightful chronicler of the ways in which people maneuver through the past, and through loss, grief and love. Though <em>The Passage</em> is a different sort of book, Cronin hasn&#x2019;t lost his skill for creating deeply moving character portraits. Throughout, in moments both large and small, readers will find the kind of complicated and heartfelt relationships that Cronin has made his specialty. Though the cast of characters is large, they are never mere pawns. The individual lives are brought to us with a vivid tenderness, and at the center of the story is not only vampires and gun battles but also quite simply a quiet meditation on the love of a man for his adopted daughter. As a fan of Cronin&#x2019;s earlier work, I found it exciting to see him developing these thoughtful character studies in an entirely different context.</p> <p>There are also certain kinds of books expand outwards beyond the borders of their covers. They make us wish for encyclopedias and maps, genealogies and indexes, appendixes that detail the adventures of the minor characters we loved but only briefly glimpsed. <em>The Passage</em> is that kind of book, too. There is a dense web of mythology and mystery that roots itself into your brain--even as you are turning the pages as quickly as you can. Complex secrets and untold stories peer out from the edges of the plot in a way that fires the imagination, so that the world of the novel seems to extend outwards, a whole universe--parts of which we glimpse in great detail--and yet we long to know even more. I hope it won&#x2019;t be saying too much to say that there are actually two universes in this novel, one overlapping the other: there is the world before the virus, and the world after, and one of the pleasures of the book is the way that those two worlds play off one another, each one twisting off into a garden of forking and intertwined paths. I think, for example, of the scientist Jonas Lear, and his journey to a fabled site in the jungles of Bolivia where clouds of bats descend upon his team of researchers; or the little girl, Amy, whose trip to the zoo sets the animals into a frenzy--"They know what I am," she says; or one of the men in Dr. Lear&#x2019;s experiment, Subject Zero, monitored in his cell as he hangs "like some kind of giant insect in the shadows." These characters and images weave their way through the story in different forms, recurring like icons, and there are threads to be connected, and threads we cannot quite connect--yet. And I hope that there will be some questions that will not be solved at all, that will just exist, as the universe of <em>The Passage</em> takes on a strange, uncanny life of its own. </p> <p>It takes two different kinds of books to work a reader up into that hypnotic, swept away feeling. The author needs to create both a deep intimacy with the characters, and an expansive, strange-but-familiar universe that we can be immersed in. <em>The Passage</em> is one of those rare books that has both these elements. I envy those readers who are about to experience it for the first time. </p> <p><strong>Danielle Trussoni Reviews <em>The Passage</em></strong></p> <p><b>Danielle Trussoni is the author of <em>Falling Through the Earth: A Memoir</em>, which was the recipient of the 2006 Michener-Copernicus Society of America Award, a BookSense pick, and one of <em>The New York Times</em> Ten Best Books of 2006. Her first novel <em>Angelology</em> will be published in 30 countries. Read her review of <em>The Passage</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Justin Cronin&#x2019;s <em>The Passage</em> is a dark morality tale of just how frightening things can become when humanity transgresses the laws of nature.</p> <p>The author of two previous novels, Cronin, in his third book, imagines the catastrophic possibilities of a vampiric bat virus unleashed upon the world. Discovered by the U.S. Military in South America, the virus is transported to a laboratory in the Colorado mountains where it is engineered to create a more invincible soldier. The virus&#x2019; potential benefits are profound: it has the power to make human beings immortal and indestructible. Yet, like Prometheus&#x2019; theft of fire from the Gods, knowledge and technological advancement are gained at great price: After the introduction of the virus into the human blood pool, it becomes clear that there will be hell to pay. The guinea pigs of the NOAH experiment, twelve men condemned to die on death row, become a superhuman race of vampire-like creatures called Virals. Soon, the population of the earth is either dead or infected, their minds controlled telepathically by the Virals. As most of human civilization has been wiped out by the Virals, the few surviving humans create settlements and live off the land with a fortitude the pilgrims would have admired. Only Amy, an abandoned little girl who becomes a mystical antidote to the creatures&#x2019; powers, will be able to save the world.</p> <p><em>The Passage</em> is no quick read, but a sweeping dystopian epic that will utterly transport one to another world, a place both haunting and horrifying to contemplate. Cronin weaves together multiple story lines that build into a journey spanning one hundred years and nearly 800 pages. While vampire lore lurks in the background--the Virals nick necks in order to infect humans, are immortal and virtually indestructible, and do most of their hunting at night--Cronin is more interested in creating an apocalyptic vision along the lines of Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;s <em>The Road</em>.</p> <p>Taking place in a futuristic America where New Orleans is a military zone, Jenna Bush is the Governor of Texas and citizens are under surveillance, <em>The Passage</em> offers a gruesome and twisted version of reality, a terrifying dream world in which our very worst nightmares come true. Ultimately, like the best fiction, <em>The Passage</em> explores what it means to be human in the face of overwhelming adversity. The thrill comes with the knowledge that Amy and the Virals must face off in a grand battle for the fate of humanity.</p> <p><strong>Questions for Justin Cronin</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><b>Q:</b> What is <em>The Passage</em>?<br> <b>A:</b> A passage is, of course, a journey, and the novel is made up of journeys. But the notion of a journey in the novel, and indeed in the whole trilogy, is also metaphoric. A passage is a transition from one state or condition to another. The world itself makes such a transition in the book. So do all the characters&#x2014;as characters in a novel must. The title is also a reference to the soul&#x2019;s passage from life to death, and whatever lies in that unknown realm. Time and time again I&#x2019;ve heard it, and in my own life, witnessed it: people at the end of life want to go home. It is a literal longing, I think, to leave this world while in a place of meaning, among familiar things and faces. But it is also a celestial longing.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You are a PEN/Hemingway Award-winning author of literary fiction. Does <em>The Passage</em> represent a departure for you?<br> <b>A:</b> I think it&#x2019;d be a little silly of me not to acknowledge that <em>The Passage</em> is, in a number of ways, overtly different from my other books. But rather than calling it a &#x2018;departure,&#x2019; I&#x2019;d prefer to describe it as a progression or evolution. First of all, the themes that engage me as a person and a writer are all still present. Love, sacrifice, friendship, loyalty, courage. The bonds between people, parents and children especially. The pull of history, and the power of place, of landscape, to shape experience. And I don&#x2019;t think the writing itself is different at all. How could it be? You write how you write.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> <em>The Passage</em> takes place all across America--from Philadelphia to Houston to southern California. What prompted you to choose these specific locations?<br> <b>A:</b> Many of the major locations in the novel are, in fact, places I have lived. Except for a long stint in Philadelphia, and now Houston, my life has been a bit nomadic. I was raised in the Northeast, but after college, I ping-ponged all over the country for a while. In some ways, shaking off my strictly Northeastern point of view has been the central project of my adult life. This gave me not only a sense of the sheer immensity of the continent, but also the great diversity of its textures, both geographical and cultural, and I wanted the book to capture this feeling of vastness, especially when the narrative jumps forward a hundred years and the continent has become depopulated. One of the most striking impressions of my travels across the country is how empty a lot of it is. You can pull off the road in Kansas or Nevada or Utah or Texas and stand in the quiet with only the wind for company and it seems as if civilization has already ended, that you&#x2019;re all alone on the planet. It&#x2019;s a wonderful and a terrifying feeling at the same time, and while I was writing the book, I decided I would travel every mile my characters did, in order to capture not only the details of place, but the feeling of place.<br><br> The writer Charles Baxter once said (more or less) that you know you&#x2019;ve come to the end of a story when you&#x2019;ve found a way to get your characters back to where they started. The end of <em>The Passage</em> is meant to create another beginning, and the space for book two to unfold.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your daughter was the spark that set your writing of <em>The Passage</em> in motion. What else drove you to delve into such an epic undertaking?<br> <b>A:</b> The other force at work was something more personal and writerly. One of the reasons that the story of <em>The Passage</em> had such a magnetic effect on me was that I felt myself reclaiming the impulses that led me to become a writer in the first place. Like my daughter, I was a big reader as a kid. I lived in the country, with no other kids around, and spent most of my childhood either with my nose in a book or wandering around the woods with my head in some imagined narrative or another. It was much later, of course, that I formally became a student of literature, and decided that writing was something I wanted to do professionally. But the groundwork was all laid back then, reading with a flashlight under the covers.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did you have the narrative completely mapped out before you started, or did certain developments take you by surprise?<br> <b>A: </b> I had it mostly mapped out, but the book is in charge. I split and recombined some characters (mostly secondary ones.) I tend to think in terms of general narrative goals; the details work themselves out as you go, just so long as you remember the destination. And to that extent, the book followed the map I made with my daughter quite closely.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> When will we get to read the next book?<br> <b>A:</b> Two years (fingers wishfully crossed). </p> <br>Born and raised in New England, JUSTIN CRONIN is the author of <b>The Summer Guest</b> &#x2014; a Booksense national bestseller &#x2014; and <b>Mary and O'Neil</b>, which won the PEN/Hemingway Award and the Stephen Crane Prize, both for best debut fiction of the year.

They were her promise of spring, of better times. Today Seattle spreads over the carved-out forests, and her sweetbriar grows wild along the beaches, tiny bits of pink in spring green, a gentle reminder of days before. </p><p>So much of what is Seattle is because of the Denny family. Street names are the most obvious: Denny Way, James Street, Boren Avenue. Other things, not quite so obvious but well recognized, are some of the city parks, Denny Hill, and the University of Washington. But sadly, so much as been lost and forgotten. Arthur Denny, considered the Father of Seattle, in a preface to a small book he wrote in 1888, stated: </p><p>"Let it be the pride of old settlers to state the truth. It is no time for romancing or painting fancy sketches when we are nearing the end of our voyage. The work is too serious for fiction." </p><p>The old settlers have crossed over. The facts lie buried with the settlers or shelved in dusty order on library stacks. This series, SEATTLE SWEETBRIAR, is the recreated story of those forgotten men and women. Despite Arthur's admonition to state nothing but facts, I have taken the facts as they are known, romanticized upon them, and painted a fancy sketch. </p><p>I hope to bring Arthur's "old settlers" out of their graves and off the shelves, to bring alive again the beginnings of an important American city. Over a hundred years "after the fact" perhaps the sound of wind can be brought back, the call of the gulls, the wetness of the rain, the throb of the heart. Perhaps Louisa Boren's story can live again. Her sweetbriar still grows--the scent still rides the sea breeze in spring.</p></p><h2>Living time and the integration of the life</h2><p>Stained edges and an annotation are the only major drawbacks of this copy.

Just days before they were to be married, his fianc�e called off the wedding. Luckily, his large support network of family and friends wouldn't let him succumb to his misery. They decided Franz should have a wedding and a honeymoon anyway- there just wouldn't be a bride at the ceremony, and Franz' travel companion would be his brother, Kurt.<br><br>During the "honeymoon," Franz reconnected with his brother and began to look at his life with newfound perspective. The brothers decided to leave their old lives behind them. They quit their jobs, sold all their possessions, and traveled around the world, visiting fifty-three countries for the next two years. In <i>Honeymoon With My Brother</i>, Franz recounts this remarkable journey, during which he turned his heartbreak into an opportunity to learn about himself, the world, and the brother he hardly knew.<br></p><p>Franz Wisner had the world by the tail. He was engaged to the beautiful Annie, with whom he shared a passion for conservative politics and a command of quotes from the movie <i>This Is Spinal Tap</i>. He worked as a government-relations official for a California real-estate giant, rubbing elbows with bigwig politicians. But then his fianc�e dumped him days before their wedding, and his boss demoted him. So he dragged his younger brother, Kurt, a Seattle realtor and divorc�, to Costa Rica for his already-scheduled honeymoon, where Wisner spilled his guts to a prostitute in the hotel bar. ("Not once did it occur to me that I was having a heart-to-heart with a woman who faked orgasms for a living.") <p> Both inspired and desperate, the two quit their jobs, sold their houses, gave away their belongings, and traveled the world for two years, romping through Europe in a newly purchased Saab, then hitting the Middle East, Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa. Along the way, Wisner got to know his brother in a way he never had ("Kurt had become ... my new best friend") and fought to move past his failed relationship.</p><p> Wisner's story is straightforward, heartfelt, and highly readable--though without any true, biting insights--and should connect with readers who've gone through a breakup, career change, or midlife crisis, or fantasized about quitting the rat race. His best travel tip? Throw away the guidebooks, and talk to the locals instead. <i>--Andy Boynton</i></p>Franz Wisner is a writer/vagabond who, in a previous reincarnation, used to work as a lobbyist, a public relations executive, and a government press secretary. During his world journeys, he published numerous travel articles and opinion pieces, which appeared in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, ABC News on-line, and <i>Coast Magazine</i>, among others. Franz and his brother, Kurt, are currently traveling the globe for their next book, also with St. Martin's Press.<br></p><h2>Zomo the Rabbit: A Trickster Tale from West Africa</h2><p>Zomo the rabbit, a trickster from West Africa, wants wisdom. But he must accomplish three apparently impossible tasks before Sky God will give him what he wants. Is he clever enough to do as Sky God asks? &#x201c;The tale moves along with the swift concision of a good joke, right down to its satisfying punch line.&#x201d;--<i>Publishers Weekly </i>&#x201c;Wildly exuberant, full of slapstick and mischief, this version of an enduring Nigerian trickster tale, featuring a clever rabbit, is a storyteller&#x2019;s delight.&#x201d;--<i>Booklist</i><br></p><p><b>GERALD MCDERMOTT</b> (1941-2012) was an internationally acclaimed author-illustrator&nbsp;of books for children. A graduate of Pratt Institute in New York City and a lifelong artist, he&nbsp;began his career as&nbsp;an animated filmmaker before moving into the creation of children's books based on storytelling traditions from around the world. He was awarded the Caldecott Medal and two Caldecott Honors; his extensive and influential body of work includes six popular picture books focusing on the trickster motif. Devoted to oral tradition and the transformative power of mythology, he was the first Fellow of the Joseph Campbell Foundation and served as a consultant on mythology in education. <b>www.geraldmcdermott.com</b>Kindergarten-Grade 3-- McDermott tells the story of Zomo the rabbit, the trickster who originated in Nigeria and who lives on in the lore of the Caribbean and the United States. When the irresponsible black rabbit asks the Sky God for wisdom, he is given three impossible tasks: he must get the scales of Big Fish, the milk of Wild Cow, and the tooth of Leopard. He does all these things and in the end the Sky God rewards him with wisdom, and warns that next time he sees his victims, he had better run fast. This colorful rendition of the story is done with the kind of bold graphics that gave McDermott's early works their immediate popularity. The horizon is low on the page so that there is a great sense of air and space. The bright gold of the sky adds warmth. The illustrations masterfully integrate a variety of styles the artist has used in the past. His characters are more realistically drawn than in his earliest work, but they are adorned with dramatic graphic patterns. It is larger and more visually expansive than McDermott's Anansi the Spider (1972) or The Magic Tree (1973; o.p., both Holt). With its small but triumphant hero clad in a colorful dashiki and a cap, its dazzling design, and its great good humor, this story will be a pleasure to use with children. --Marilyn Iarusso, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Little Primer of Tu Fu</h2><p>The standard introduction to the poetry of Tu Fu (712-770) regarded by many Chinese as their country&#39;s greatest poet.

As Wonder Woman, she's been through culture shock going from her distant home to the outside world. While she has adjusted somewhat to the differences, much about this world still surprises her. As the story opens, Diana is confused when a young woman comes to her and offers herself in the ancient ways of supplication. Diana isn't sure what to make of Danielle Wellys, but she accepts the woman as a supplicant and makes "Hiketeia," binding herself to protect Danielle. However, Danielle has problems that not even Wonder Woman may be able to guard her from. Danielle's been seeking vengeance since her sister was murdered, and her mission has involved everyone from the ancient Greek Furies to Batman. As Batman, Wonder Woman and the Furies clash over her fate, Danielle watches and makes a decision that will affect them all. Rucka just began a stint as the regular writer of the monthly Wonder Woman comic, but this is his first real exploration of the character. His treatment of the myths and lore associated with Wonder Woman/Princess Diana is impressive. Jones's beautiful pencils and attention to detail capture the characters' heart and emotion, as well as the soul of the cities and other background objects. This stand-alone story is a great introduction to the character and background of Wonder Woman, a seminal superhero who usually runs a distant third to Batman and Superman in DC's pantheon. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In her fury, she blasted the mammoth-hide shelters of the People with a gust that battered the frozen skins over the head of the one called Runs In Light.<br>Blinking awake, he listened to the howling gale. Around him, the others of the People huddled in their thick robes, deep asleep. Someone snored softly. Cold, so cold...An uncontrollable shiver made him wish they had more fat to burn in the fire hole, but it was gone. Seventeen Long Darks hadn&#x2019;t put much muscle on his skinny bones to start with&#x2014;and famine had wasted the rest.<br>Even old Broken Branch muttered that she&#x2019;d never seen a winter like this.<br>Carried on the wind, a faint whimpering came from behind the shelters. Some animal scratched for food scraps the People had long since chipped from the ice. Wolf?<br>Heart pounding with hope, Runs In Light traced chill-stiff fingers over his atlatl&#x2014;the ornately carved throwing stick used by the People to catapult stone-tipped darts. He squirmed out from under frosty hides. Creeping tendrils of cold stroked the last warm places on his body as, bent low, he stepped silently over fur-wrapped sleepers. Even in the icy air, the stink of the shelter&#x2014;occupied for months&#x2014;came to his nose.<br>Buried under the hides, Laughing Sunshine&#x2019;s baby squeaked its hunger. A spear of sound, its pain reflected in Runs In Light&#x2019;s pinched expression.<br>&#x201c;Where are you, Father Sun?&#x201d; he demanded harshly, tightening his grip on the atlatl until his fingers ached. Then, like a seal through an ice hole, he wiggled under the crawl flap. Wind Woman rushed down from the black northwest, shoving him backward. He steadied himself against the shelter, squinting into the lighter darkness beyond. Snow crystals chittered mutedly on the packed ice.<br>Wolf&#x2019;s muffled sounds came again, claws scratching at something buried in the snow.<br>Runs In Light circled, following the lee of a drift, hoping Wind Woman would keep his scent from wolf&#x2019;s keen nose. On hands and knees, he crawled to the top of the drift and slithered over the crest on his belly. Dark against the stained snow, wolf struggled to dig Flies Like A Seagull&#x2019;s body from the clinging ice.<br>He bowed his head in sorrow.<br>He&#x2019;d found his mother frozen in her robes a week before. Echoes of her stories would haunt his mind forever, voice warm as she told him the ways of the People. He smiled wistfully, remembering the light in her eyes as she chanted of the great Dreamers: of Heron and Sun Walker and other legendary heroes of the People. How soft and caring her hand had been as it resettled the furs around a younger and happier Runs In Light&#x2019;s cold face.<br>A bitter chill touched his soul as he saw a more recent visage of her toothless death rictus&#x2014;her frost-grayed eyes.<br>So many had starved.<br>Too weak to do more than stumble out of the shelters, the People had carried Flies Like A Seagull&#x2019;s corpse only this far. Here, on the ice, they&#x2019;d left her to stare at the skies, praying and singing her soul up to the Blessed Star People. Wind Woman had blown her stiff corpse over, snow drifting softly to bury her&#x2014;until wolf came to chew her frozen flesh.<br>The urge to rush down over the drift, screaming his rage and hurt, rose powerfully. He forced it back. Food, wolf was food.<br><em>Father Sun looks away when hunger forces hunter to stalk hunter. What had they done that He would punish them so</em>?<br>Runs In Light took a deep breath, rising slowly to his knees, judging the distance.<br>Wolf stopped short, head coming up, pointed ears pricked. Willing himself to remain motionless, Runs In Light gauged the wind, waiting, hoping his hunger-robbed limbs wouldn&#x2019;t betray him this last time.<br>Wolf turned his head, sniffing, gaunt ribs working as he searched the wind, an uneasy presence leaving him wary.<br>Runs In Light cleared his thoughts, shifting his eyes slightly to the side. He breathed softly, relaxing, forcing gnawing twists of hunger from his consciousness. He himself had experienced that feeling of being watched, that subtle prickle of eyes upon him. For long moments he waited while wolf&#x2019;s nerves settled and the animal&#x2019;s gray nose dropped to gnaw the corpse again.<br>Runs In Light tensed&#x2014;threw his weight into the atlatl&#x2014;and watched the dart as it arced. True to the Spirit Power he&#x2019;d breathed into the shaft, it caught wolf just behind the ribs.<br>The animal yipped&#x2014;a startled leap carrying it straight up. Landing on all fours, wolf shot away into the night.<br>Hollow hunger voices echoed in his head as Runs In Light followed, the dark blotches of blood on the snow. He stopped, dropping to one knee. Weakly raising his atlatl, he pounded the stain to chip it loose. With a mittened hand he lifted a bit of red-splotched snow, sniffing. Gut blood, it carried the pungency of severed intestines. Burning blood, it would slow wolf, bring him to an eventual stop.<br>From blood smear to blood smear, he worked out the trail, growing uneasy as the distance stretched between him and camp. Wind Woman&#x2019;s breath shifted across the land, blowing snow to fill his tracks. The eyes of the Long Dark lay heavy and menacing upon him.<br>He gazed upward, murmuring to the spirits, &#x201c;Leave me alone. I must find wolf. Don&#x2019;t eat my soul...don&#x2019;t....&#x201d; The drain on his soul abated, but the presence clung in the air, floating, waiting to see if his honor proved worthy.<br>In the lee of a drift, he studied the tracks. Wolf had stopped here and even lain down for a short while. A blacker patch of blood stained the snow.<br>Runs In Light&#x2019;s fingers trembled inside the heavy mittens as he used a stone dart point to carefully pry the frozen blood from the ice. Heedless of the wolf hair sticking to it, he chewed, grimacing at the gut-juice taste. Food. The first he&#x2019;d enjoyed in four days.<br>Four days? The Dreamer&#x2019;s number. His mother had told him that. A day for each of the directions to bring the soul awake.<br>He stood, slowly scanning the landscape, whispering, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re here, wolf. I feel your spirit close.&#x201d;<br>In the Long Dark, the white waste gleamed deep blue, shadows of purple creeping along the drifts. To the north, the land undulated, jagged peaks shining starkly in the light of the Star People above.<br>Eyes to the snow, he clutched his weapons: two darts, both as long as he was tall, and his atlatl, blessed by the blood of mammoth and Grandfather White Bear. He shuffled ahead, pace just fast enough to keep warm. Hunger stalked his rubbery legs as he stalked his prey.<br>Wind-sculpted snow wavered, shimmering in his tear-blurred eyes. How long since he&#x2019;d slept? Two days?<br>&#x201c;Dream Hunt?&#x201d; he muttered hoarsely, wondering at the unreal sensations; hunger and fatigue played with his mind and senses. He staggered, dazed by his swirling balance.<br>&#x201c;I must catch you, wolf.&#x201d;<br>The soul eaters of the Long Dark drifted closer, eerie whispers haunting his ears. He clamped his jaw tightly, crying, &#x201c;The People need meat. Hear me, wolf? We&#x2019;re starving!&#x201d;<br>* * *<br>An age-cracked voice murmured in Light&#x2019;s shifting memory, &#x201c;Sun Father&#x2019;s losing his strength. Cloud Mother wraps herself around Blue Sky Man and sucks up his warmth.&#x2019; The old shaman, Crow Caller, had blinked, one eye black, the other white with blindness as he told the People of coming famine.<br>Seeing only snow, the aged leader had prophesied, &#x201c;This year mammoth will die. Musk ox will die. Caribou will stay far south with buffalo. The People will wither.&#x201d;<br>And it was so. The melting time during the Long Light had barely lasted through one turning of Moon Woman&#x2019;s face. Then Cloud Mother had covered the skies. Constant rain and snow raged out of the north to kill the Long Light. Cold lay heavy on the land when the grasses, willows, and tundra plants should have grown tall to feed mammoth.<br>Crow Caller spent his time singing, praying for a Dream. The old shaman trapped Seagull once and twisted his neck four turns. The limp bird in his callused brown hands, he&#x2019;d sliced through the down feathers with an obsidian blade to expose the guts. He&#x2019;d peered, his one good eye gleaming, to see what news Seagull brought from so far out among the floating ice mountains on the great salt water to the north.<br>&#x201c;Back,&#x201d; he had croaked. &#x201c;We must go north...back the way we came.&#x201d;<br>The People had looked at each other anxiously, remembering the ones who pursued them, the ones they called the Others: mammoth hunters like themselves, but men who murdered and chased the People from the fertile hunting grounds to the north. Could the People go back? Could they face those fierce warriors?<br>Once&#x2014;so the elders told&#x2014;the People had lived on the other side of the huge mountains to the west. There, Father Sun had given them a wondrous land of rivers abounding in grassy plains rich in game. Then the Others had come, driving them from the land, pushing them north and east against the salt water. Father Sun, in his wisdom, had given them a new land at the mouth of the Big River where they could see the Big Ice extending out into the salt water. The Others had followed, pushing the People away from the lush hunting grounds at the mouth of the Big River, pushing them down this last long valley, ever to the south. Now the ground rose, the mountains hemming them from the west, the Big Ice encroaching from the east. What was left? And behind the Others continued to push, forcing the People ever higher into the rocky hills devoid of game.<br>So the elders debated while the People worried. Was there enough game in this high rocky country where little grass grew for mammoth and caribou? What would the People do?<br>And then the young hunter call...</p></p><h2>Sins Out of School (Dorothy Martin Mysteries, No. 8)</h2><p>Yearning for a traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner, expatriate American and amateur sleuth Dorothy Martin finds her plans for her feast threatened when she is asked to assist at the local school after teacher Amanda Doyle, the prime suspect in the murder of her husband, mysteriously vanishes. Reprint.</p><p>"When people see a gray-haired woman in a silly hat, they tend to dismiss her as a harmless crank," says sixtyish Dorothy Martin, an American who has lived for years in the ancient British hamlet of Sherebury, most recently with her retired detective husband. A day spent as a substitute teacher's aide leads her to Amanda, the teacher: closed, terrified, and soon accused of the murder of her monstrously repressive husband. Dorothy cannot keep out of it, especially when she meets the couple' s intense nine-year-old daughter. An estranged father who is a major public figure; a religious sect leached of all kindness; and a lot of bad accounting keep Dorothy on track, even as she tries to produce an American Thanksgiving in England and not tread too heavily on the toes of the investigating officers, erstwhile colleagues of her spouse. Dorothy may feel--and act--her age, but she is energetic and forthright, and an attractive and interesting companion even when the threads of the mystery unravel a bit. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Simultaneous. IP.</p><p>On May 12, 1988, Claudia Brenner and her companion, Rebecca Wight, parked their car on Dead Woman's Hollow Road before starting on a hike on a part of the Appalachian Trail that runs through Pine Grove Furnace State Park in Pennsylvania. The next night, Friday the 13th, Brenner would make a four-mile hike out?this time alone and with five bullet wounds, four in her head and neck. Just two bullets had hit Wight, but one destroyed her liver and killed her. This is Brenner's recollection of the attack; of the hunt for her assailant, Stephen Roy Carr; her recovery; and her activism against anti-gay crimes. The bare outlines of Brenner's story are very powerful, but awkward writing and unnecessary switching of perspective from first person to a wildly omniscient third person ("Anne wished she could be at Hershey [Medical Center] that second.... Anne pushed a picture of Claudia's face with bullet holes in it out of her head") weaken it. More disturbing are Brenner's assumptions of homophobia, even on the part of two policemen who by all accounts acted honorably ("Although they were no less homophobic than the average state trooper, their units no more enlightened, they became committed to me, a lesbian crime victim and my lesbian family.") Without more supporting evidence, this kind of aside amounts to stereotyping, which Brenner, of all people, should abhor. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.In May 1988, on the Appalachian Trail in Pennsylvania, a horrific shooting attack left 28 year old Rebecca Wight dead. Her partner, Claudia Brenner, was seriously wounded. In Eight Bullets: One Woman's Story Of Surviving Anti-Gay Violence, Claudia Brenner writes a profoundly personal, emotionally riveting, politically energizing account of the murder and its aftermath: her path to recovery and activism. Eight Bullets is about a lesbian victim of a violent hate crime, her family and community, as they grapple with trauma, the medical system, the police nd courts, the media. It is about the realities of homophobia (in the world and in themselves) and the existence of friends and strangers willing to work together to seek justice and healing. Most of all, it is about one woman's courage and determination after encountering the unspeakable. Claudia Brenner explores both her pain and the redemptive power of love an shared commitments in this deeply affecting book. In the process, she offers inspiration for our own struggles. Eight Bullets stands as a testament and as a warning. The testament to courage in the face of loss. The warning: The price of freedom is a blood price. Only by uniting together can we survive together. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Bare Bear</h2><p>Rhymed text and illustrations reveal what the polar bear has on under his familiar white furry coat.</p><p></p><h2>So You Wanna Be a Rock &amp; Roll Star: How I Machine-Gunned a Roomful Of Record Executives and Other True Tales from a Drummer's Life</h2><p><p><b>A hilarious inside look at the real business of popular music by the drummer of Semisonic that does for rock and roll what Jim Bouton's <i>Ball Four</i> did for baseball.<br></b><br>After years of working day jobs and making music in his basement, Jacob Slichter wondered if his dreams of rock stardom were a vain illusion.

He has read his road diaries (originally published on the Semisonic website) on NPR's <i>Morning Edition</i>. With his multiplatinum-selling band Semisonic he has appeared on the Jay Leno, David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, and Craig Kilborn shows.</p>Chapter I<br>Jump Start<br>It's never snowed in Minnesota during the month of July. The boundary waters up north, however, have tasted light accumulations in August and June, and as for the months in between, keep those winter boots handy. From autumn to spring, Minnesota is a frozen soundscape of snowplows, snow shovels, windshield scrapers, and auto ignitions laboring to turn over. Once, to get into my ice-entombed car, I needed a rubber mallet, seventy-five feet of extension cord, and a blow dryer. The long brutal winters, however, are sometimes credited with fostering Minneapolis's vital music scene. Without such horrible weather keeping them inside with their guitars, the theory goes, the world might never have heard of Bob Dylan, Prince, the Suburbs, the Replacements, Husker Du, Babes in Toyland, the Time, Soul Asylum, or the Jayhawks.<br><br>It takes more than blizzards and musicians to sustain this thriving scene. It takes fans, and the fans in the Twin Cities are famous for pushing their cars out of snowdrifts, driving down to Minneapolis's prized rock club, First Avenue, and lining up around the block in subzero temperatures on a weekday night to get through the doors before the tickets sell out. Those fans and the bands they love make a potent combination. I'll never forget watching Soul Asylum rule the stage while the body heat from the crowd of 2,000 thawed my frozen jaw. With their amplifiers turned up past the breaking point, the band spilled back and forth across the stage and brought the crowd seesawing with them, as if we were all on the deck of a ship. Singer Dave Pirner whipped his long hair in circles and screamed, "I want somebody to shove! I need somebody to shove! I want somebody to shove me!" An overexcited fan launched a cup of beer from twenty rows back, and it soared over the crowd and exploded on Karl Mueller's bass guitar. Pirner pointed into the crowd and shouted into the mike. "We're gonna find out who fuckin' threw that, and when we do, we're gonna kick your ass. And everyone here's gonna help us do it!" The crowd roared its approval.<br><br>I was a musician in my early thirties, still living under the cloud of disappointment that had followed me since graduating six years earlier from Harvard, a place for which I was poorly prepared and which in every regard had annihilated my self-confidence. I had intended to major in music, but after completing a year of study at the Berklee College of Music, for which Harvard's music department had promised me credit, I received a cold letter from the chairman of the department rescinding this promise and inviting me to find another course of study. I wandered from major to major, eventually settling on Afro-American studies, where I quietly explored my interests in race, politics, music, and literature. I entertained visions of graduate school, but such daydreaming was brought to an abrupt end when I opened the envelope containing the miserable grade given to my senior thesis, and the accompanying terse comments on its shabbiness. I graduated with a lackluster record and threw my diploma in a storage box. So much for plan B; back to plan A--rock stardom.<br><br>I proceeded with a move to San Francisco. I worked at various day jobs--selling synthesizers and drum machines at Guitar Center, making copies and filing them for executives at Chevron, and then administering the office of Saint Gregory's Episcopal Church--and wrote songs at night, recording them in my bedroom. Alas, songwriting vexed me. The emotions that I longed to put into words and music proved beyond my reach whenever I laid my fingers on a guitar, piano keyboard, or pen. I wanted to address themes of social justice through the poetry of personal reflection. What I ended up with were a stack of legal pads filled with half-finished lyrics, manuscript paper with half-finished melodies, and a cassette of the twelve songs I managed to write in five years. The extent of my public performances was also minimal, spanning a period of three months during which my friend Hal Movius and I performed on the stages of the Paradise Lounge and the Hotel Utah. On these five or six occasions, we were applauded thoughtfully by a few strangers and enthusiastically by twenty members of Saint Gregory's Church.<br><br>I left San Francisco with little to show for my musical aspirations and hoped the legendary scene in Minneapolis would be the launch pad for a career that had not yet gotten off the ground. I knew a number of musicians in town, but for the most part I continued to do what I had done in San Francisco--work a day job and write and record songs in my basement studio at night, playing the drums, keyboards, and making use of my fledgling skills on guitar. The rare feat of finishing a song was cause for celebration. I'd listen to the recording for days, triumphant at first and then mortified by its shortcomings--my sugary melodies and lyrics, my inept guitar playing, and most of all my quavering baritone voice. As I lay in bed at night, I'd hear another page tearing off of my life's shortening calendar. I was running out of time, hair, and dignity. The mantle of failure weighed on me, no place more than at my day job downtown, where I attended to the photocopying and envelope-stuffing needs of executives who sold retirement plans.<br><br>"So, Jake, I hear you're a musician. What kind of music do you play?"<br><br>"It's . . . hard to describe."<br><br>"I see. Where do you play?"<br><br>"I have a studio in my basement."<br><br>"Good for you. I need five hundred copies of this report stapled and collated by the end of the day."<br><br>By contrast, my closest friends in town had no day jobs; they had a record deal with A&amp;M Records. Dan Wilson, a friend of mine from college, his brother Matt, John Munson, and Elaine Harris were the members of Trip Shakespeare, a rock band whose dark psychedelic sound entranced fans around the country, and especially in the Midwest, where they performed for capacity crowds at the Metro in Chicago, the Shadow in Kansas City, and First Avenue in Minneapolis. To dine out with Dan, John, Matt, or Elaine was an exciting chance to be seen with a rock star who needed an unlisted phone number. It was also an occasion to silently compare career stats between them and me: one record deal to none, four albums to none, tens of thousands of fans to none.<br><br>Dan was the closest of these friends. I had met him during our freshman week at Harvard, when he heard me playing the drums in a dormitory common room. He stuck his head in the door and said, "I'll be back with my bass." (He played bass in college and later switched to guitar.) We jammed for several hours that day and in the following weeks. Our musical tastes ran in different directions--I stuck to soul and funk, while Dan was more excited by English rock and punk--so it wasn't until our senior year that we played in a band together.<br><br>It was with Dan that I moved to San Francisco, following the trail of his girlfriend, Diane. Dan and I shared an apartment, where I saw his exhausting focus firsthand. A Phi Beta Kappa, he had graduated Harvard <i>summa cum laude</i> and won the Louis Sudler Prize in the Arts, awarded to the senior who demonstrates outstanding artistic achievement, which in Dan's case was not in music but painting. In San Francisco, he carried on a double artistic life, painting and songwriting, in addition to working various day jobs. Even his days off began with a double shot of espresso and then proceeded with a furious pace of activity that was unsettling to watch, especially given my meager output. The sound of his pen scrawling across the pages of his journal could keep me from reading. (Today, the snap of his fingers on a computer keyboard can make one twitch.) In conversation, his eyes focused into an intent gaze and often he'd hold up his hand like a stop sign. Then, having remembered some forgotten task, he'd get up and disappear for a twenty-minute flurry of phone calls. Upon returning to the room, he might sit down and stare at me.<br><br>"Jake, I have a question for you."<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"How would you like to go with me to look at some photographs at the museum, get a bowl of fish soup, drop in on Diane, and then get the new R.E.M. album on the way home?" Even his mornings off intimidated me. We had planned to start a new band together, but it never happened. Within two years, Dan returned to his hometown of Minneapolis to join Trip Shakespeare, which his brother Matt had started. While touring and recording, he continued his parallel career as a painter and had two successful gallery shows in Minneapolis.<br><br>The occasion of Dan and Diane's wedding provided my first opportunity to visit Minneapolis and glimpse its famed music scene for myself. In three days, I met a dozen musicians, several of whom encouraged me to relocate to the Twin Cities. The following year, I did, and before long I was standing in the crowd at First Avenue, awed by the spectacle of Dave Pirner promising revenge on behalf of his beer-splattered bass player.<br><br>I got to know Dan's bandmate John after moving to Minneapolis, when for a brief time we shared an apartment. He had dropped out of college, where he had studied Chinese, to play in bands and make records. John's days started slowly, and it wasn't unusual for me to return from my day job to find him sitting on the couch, luxuriating in a pair of flannel-lined jeans and a soft wool sweater, stroking his cat, and savoring a cigarette and a glass of merlot while listening to Charles Mingus. As evening arrived, he might stand up and yawn and then, after gliding through the streets in a battered but well-heated 1967 Sedan de Ville, drop in on a friend unannounced. Occasionally, without consulting the weather forecast, he would disappear into the woods on the Canadian border for solo camping trips whose length was never predetermined. His friends held their breath waiting for his return, and when he resurfaced to knock on a friend's door at bedtime, he would walk in, sit down in the living room, and recount with nonchalance nearly freezing to death in his tent and his subsequent escape from a blizzard.<br><br>As apartment sharing goes, it's hard to say which threatened me more, Dan's harrying productivity or John's alarming commitment to relaxation. John's casual manner, however, belied the fact that he was the best musician in any of the Minneapolis rock bands. There was no question in my mind that he was better on bass than anyone else was on guitar, piano, or drums. In addition to that, he was a gifted producer whose talents were in constant demand. For a man who seemed to ease through life, John had produced several albums and EPs for Minneapolis bands and singer/songwriters--this in addition to rehearsing, touring, and recording with Trip Shakespeare. Indeed, it was hard to reconcile the volume of his studio accomplishments and the long hours of practice apparent in his bass playing with the same John Munson who held court in local restaurants, bars, and rock clubs, and, during the summer, on the golf course.<br><br>Both Dan and John served as mentors for my musical pursuits, listening to my songs and basement recordings, and giving me advice and encouragement. The two of them turned me on to new music, introduced me to other musicians around town, and encouraged me to write more songs and perform them, but I continued to flounder.<br><br>Then, in the summer of 1992, a friend of ours, Heather Keena, asked John and Dan to play at her college graduation party. She suggested they ask me to play drums, perhaps in the interest of keeping a low-key affair intended for friends from escalating into a madhouse of Trip Shakespeare fans. This was a great opportunity to show off my drumming, my greatest strength as a musician and, as Dan stressed, something I had long ignored. I would be seen and heard playing with two stars of the Minneapolis scene, the two best musicians I knew.<br><br>Hours before the party, Dan with his guitar and John with his bass joined me in my basement, and we learned a dozen sixties and seventies covers. That night, the three of us climbed up onto the small stage at the 400 Bar and slammed through "In Dreams" by Roy Orbison, "Drift Away" by Dobie Gray, and whatever other songs we could remember from our afternoon rehearsal. Dan's brother Matt played with us for a song, and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum joined us for "Dancing in the Moonlight" by King Harvest. Sharing the stage with these local luminaries was a rush, as were the cheers that greeted our strong performance.<br><br>This impromptu set was such a success that in the ensuing weeks the three of us recorded some new songs of Dan's (with small contributions from me)--songs that suited the bare textures of our trio more than the ornamented arrangements of Trip Shakespeare. The recordings turned out great, and Dan and John thought our trio would make an interesting side project. Dan named our band Pleasure, and we looked ahead to a gap in Trip Shakespeare's schedule when we might be able to record a cheaply made album. A pair of jumper cables had thus been fastened to my lifeless career.<br><br>Meanwhile, Trip Shakespeare's voyage through the music business was not going well. They had signed their record deal just as Nirvana and Pearl Jam were changing the rock-and-roll landscape with the massive success of the grungy Seattle sound. Trip Shakespeare's sound, by contrast, was built on three-part vocal harmonies sung with operatic fervor, quirky instrumental arrangements (employing sleigh bells, bongos, and xylophones), and lyrics written in elevated speech ("In the honey time of youth / When the wind had sweet breath / When the rent was way down / I would haul for no man"). Though they sold out large clubs, they were ignored by radio, and the band members complained of a lack of support from their label, A&amp;M Records. Trip Shakespeare's albums were often missing from record stores in the towns where they performed. As the three of us recorded in my basement, Dan and John began to tell of Trip Shakespeare's tangled negotiations with their label concerning the band's most recent recordings. Then came a devastating shock: A&amp;M dropped Trip Shakespeare from their record contract. A few days later, under growing stress, the band members decided to take some time off, and soon it was clear that Trip Shakespeare had broken up.<br>Now our side project became Dan and John's main focus, as it already was for me. Dan laid out a musical manifesto. Whereas Trip Shakespeare had intentionally cordoned itself off from other music of the day, Dan wanted to make music that was a part of what was happening now. For the past year, Nirvana had been blasting everyone away with the force and fury of their sound. The radio was filling up with imitators, but Dan saw that no one would be able to sound bigger or angrier. Instead, he wanted to anticipate a post-Nirvana world with music less centered on rage, though undoubtedly inspired by the scale of Nirvana's sound. He was inspired by the melodic and lyric-based songwriting of indie bands like R.E.M., the Replacements, and Teenage Fanclub. Both he and John enjoyed the brilliant recording experimentations of other bands such as My Bloody Valentine, the Flaming Lips, and Swervedriver. All of us were interested in using sampling technology and computers to create cool instrumental loops, as hip-hop artists like Public Enemy, De La Soul, and the Beastie Boys had done for years. We wanted to write some great songs, get our hands on some samplers and distortion boxes, and marry these elements of the do-it-yourself traditions of indie rock and hip-hop to the high-production values, the wider grooves, and the vocal emphasis of pop. The result, we hoped, would be fresh and big.</p><h2>The Children&#39;s Jewish Holiday Kitchen: 70 Ways to Have Fun with Your Kids and Make Your Family&#39;s Celebrations Special</h2><p>There could be no more festive way to introduce Jewish children to their Jewish heritage than through the food associated with the holidays.

Spending much of the 1920s in Europe, Antheil returned to the US in the 1930s, and thereafter spent much of his time composing music for films and, eventually, television. As a result of this work, his style became more tonal. A man of diverse interests and talents, Antheil was constantly reinventing himself. He wrote magazine articles (one accurately predicted the development and outcome of World War II), an autobiography, a mystery novel, newspaper and music columns. In 1941 he co-patented a &#34;Secret Communications System&#34; with actress Hedy Lamarr that used a code (stored on a punched paper tape) to synchronise random frequencies, referred to as frequency hopping, with a receiver and transmitter. This technique, which is now known as spread spectrum, is now widely used in telecommunications.</p><p>George Antheil</p><h2>Third Year at Malory Towers (Dragon Books)</h2><p>For new girl Darrell Rivers, there are friends to be made, pranks to be played and fun to be had at Malory Towers in Enid Blyton&#39;s best-loved boarding school series.

A rebel against Christianity, he credits a youth pastor who &#39;loved me unconditionally&#39; with being a major factor in his conversion and subsequent decision to enter the ministry.The Quiet Room&#39;s subtitle, &#34;A Journey Out of the Torment of Madness,&#34; aptly describes this moving and compassionate audiobook about Lori Schiller&#39;s struggle and eventual triumph over schizophrenia. Mary Beth Hurt, as Lori, gives a convincing performance. Her pleasantly resonant voice conveys the confusion, terror, denial, hope and determination experienced by this patient. The narrative is well paced and the terrifying and demoralizing &#34;voices&#34; that were ever present are especially well vocalized. Although Mary Beth Hurt is the principal reader, others portray Lori&#39;s parents, roommates and psychiatrists. This manner of dramatization and the fine performances provide three hours of sensitive and satisfying listening. A.A.B.

As the only surviving examples of ancient India&#x2019;s non-Vedic religious traditions, the two religions are often grouped together as &#x2018;heterodoxies&#x2019;, but this is to ignore deep differences between Jain and Buddhist beliefs and practices. Unlike Buddhism, Jainism has hardly spread beyond the Indian subcontinent but Jainism survives in India where it is a prominent element in the mix of Indian religions today.<br> As an introduction to Jainism as a religious tradition and way of life, this book pays due attention to Jainism&#x2019;s history and doctrinal basics. However the author emphasises the ways in which formal Jain teachings are manifested in the practices of both laity and the monastic elite; explores the distinctive Jain systems of cosmographic and biological knowledge and describes how Jainism is woven into the social identities of Jain communities in modern India.<br></p><p>Trained as a social anthropologist, Lawrence A. Babb is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Asian Studies at Amherst College. He is the author of several books dealing with religion and society in India.'Understanding Jainism fulfils its aims well. The list of further reading points the student to a wide range of resources, and the glossary gives succinct definitions of key terms. Babb writes fluently, his explanations are clear, his language accessible. This is an excellent starting point for those with little or no knowledge of Jainism. This is a worthwhile addition to the shelves of any theological library and for any individual who wishes to begin to understand Jainism better.'Interreligious Insight'This short monograph is in the Dunedin &#x2018;Understanding Faith&#x2019; series edited by Frank Whaling, and it provides a fresh, well-structured, clearly written account of Jainism that is appropriate for undergraduate students and interested general readers alike. Babb cleverly weaves together methodological and interpretive issues with the history of the Jains and a sketch of the religion as it is practised in the twenty-first century... To sum up, Babb has written an intelligent book that is a pleasure to read, and deserves a wide readership.'Journal for the Academic Study of Religion&#x2018;Babb's Understanding Jainism reads like having coffee with a senior scholar deeply knowledgeable about the tradition sharing his first-hand experiences and relating his own individual ways of explaining its finer points... As a textbook, Babb's book may challenge early career undergraduates, but it will delight readers with more ability... Babb's focus on the social realities in which Jainism exists allows us to see Jainism, and Jains, as the complex actors and agents they are, and allows students to move away from questions of how properly "Jain" or not living Jains are, based on how strictly they follow the tenets of the tradition.&#x2019;Religious Studies Review 44(4) - -</p><h2>The Wisdom of Oz: Using Personal Accountability to Succeed in Everything You Do</h2><p><b>Why does the story of Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion touch us?

She lays her head gently on the shoulder of her serious fiancee and quietly awaits marriage. But she didn&#39;t count on an inner rebellion that would rock her stable routine, and her digestion. Marriage a la mode, Marian discovers, is something she literally can&#39;t stomach ... The Edible Woman is a funny, engaging novel about emotional cannibalism, men and women, and desire to be consumed.&#39;Margaret Atwood not only has a sense of humour, she has wit and style in abundance ... a joy to read&#39; Good Housekeeping&#39;Written with a brilliant angry energy&#39; Observer &#39;A witty, elegant, generous and patient writer&#39; Punch</p><p>"Chock-full of startling images, superbly and classically crafted...Kept me in stitches."<br>-<i>Saturday Night</i><p>"Extraordinarily witty, and full or ironic observation."<br>-<i>The Toronto Star</i></p><p>"Atwood has the magic of turning the particular and the parochial into the universal."<br>-<i>The Times</i> (London)<br></p>Marian has a problem.

She can even cope with Duncan, a graduate student who seems to prefer laundromats to women. But not being able to eat is a different matter. Steak was the first to go. Then lamb, pork, and the rest. Next came her incapacity to face an egg. Vegetables were the final straw. But Marian has her reasons, and what happens next provides an unusual solution. Witty, subversive, hilarious, <i>The Edible Woman</i> is dazzling and utterly original.

A ruthless and unabashed progressive, Burton terrified his opponents, ran over his friends, forged improbable coalitions, and from 1964 to 1983 became one of the most influential Representatives in the House. He also acquired more raw power than almost any left-liberal politician ever had.<br><br>Moving from grassroots campaigns to epic battles in the California state capital, and finally to the very pinnacle of power on Capitol Hill, John Jacobs's inside account of Burton's life shows how politics really works. He demonstrates the exercise of power in the hands of a superb strategist and shows an unheralded master going about his life's work during the glory years of postwar American liberalism.<br><br>Burton was an unforgettable, uncontrollable figure whose relentless day-and-night politicking distilled the raw essence of American politics. Jacobs brings to life Burton's seething, perpetual sense of outrage, gargantuan appetites, and dedication to the disenfranchized. Animated by a sometimes frightening drive for power&#x2015;his only modern counterpart is Lyndon Johnson&#x2015;Burton played a pivotal role in California and U.S. politics, championing welfare and civil rights, landmark labor legislation, environmentalism and congressional reform. His achievements included the groundbreaking black lung bill for miners and their families; Supplemental Social Security for the aged, blind, and disabled; and helping to secure America's extensive national park system.<br><br>Burton's failures were equally dramatic: in 1976, at the height of his power, he lost, by one vote, the chance to become House Majority Leader. Had he won this critical political fight, he no doubt would have become Speaker of the House.<br><br>Jacobs's account is based on Burton's personal papers and hundreds of interviews with people at every stage of his life, including four Democratic Speakers of the House. The result is a book that brilliantly demonstrates how one person can make a difference in public life.</p><p>Democratic U.S. Representative Phillip Burton was one of the most influential power brokers the House has ever known, and almost certainly the most powerful leftist in that body's history. Political journalist John Jacobs's densely packed biography charts his career from the California state legislature to Capitol Hill, including dozens of anecdotes about politics at its most cutthroat. The section on his spearheading of 1978 legislation for the national parks system is particularly fascinating. The portrait of Burton that emerges from <i>A Rage for Justice</i> is of a complex man whose intense personality generated enough ill feeling to keep him from becoming a majority leader in his party, yet still fueled more than enough political drive to push legislation through."Nobody is perfect&#x2015;certainly not the late Phillip Burton. Congressman Burton loved power and pursued it egregiously. He had a terrible temper. He was sometimes hasty and imprudent. Yet he was also a great legislator: great in his vision, great in his defense of working people, great in his passion for the environment. Few members of Congress have wielded the influence or left behind the legacy of this towering, tumultuous parliamentarian. Now, thanks to John Jacobs, there is a biography to match the depth and intensity of the man."&#x2015;Kevin Starr, State Librarian of California<br><br>"There was no more compelling political figure in the America of the 1960s and 1970s than California's Phillip Burton and now John Jacobs has written a book that fits the man&#x2015;big, boisterous, insightful, and compelling. Jacobs has captured Burton and has captured the fascinating politics of the Bay Area, California, and the House of Representatives, all in one terrific package. This is political biography at its best."&#x2015;Norman J. Ornstein, American Enterprise Institute<br><br>"Phil Burton, a prodigious overachiever, has inspired a prodigious book, filled with life and with the colorful stuff of politics. John Jacobs understands the ins and outs of Capitol Hill better than most political writers, and he understands the California political scene that Phil Burton inhabited better than anybody."&#x2015;Nelson W. Polsby, author of <i>Congress and the Presidency</i><br><br>"An extraordinary political biography by a first-rate political journalist. It is a compelling, critical, adoring, and exeptionally well-researched account of the life and times of one of the nation's most important contemporary politicians. John Jacobs shows us what a gifted insider who was proud of being a consummate politician can accomplish when he masters his profession. But Jacobs does more than that. . . he excels at portraying the man, with all his weaknesses, as well as the politician with his strengths."&#x2015;Lou Cannon, author of <i>President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime</i></p><h2>Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand</h2><p>Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand is a science fiction masterpiece, an essay on the inexplicability of sexual attractiveness, and an examination of interstellar politics among far-flung worlds.

In brief, this book is a copiously annotated list of Joyce's allusions in such areas as literature, philosophy, theology, history, and the fine arts. So awesome an undertaking would not have been possible without the prior work of such persons as Stuart Gilbert, Joseph Prescott, William York Tindall, M.J.C. Hodgart, Mabel Worthington, and many others. But the present list is more than a compilation of previously discovered allusions, for it contains many allusions that have never been suggested before, as well as some that have only been partially or mistakenly identified in earlier publications.<br><br>In preparing this work, the author has kept its usefulness to the reader foremost in mind. He often refreshed the reader's memory in concerning the context of an allusion, since its context, in one sense or another, is always the guide to its function in the novel. The entire list is fully cross-referenced and keyed by page and line to both the old and new Modern Library editions of <i>Ulysses</i>. In addition, the index is prepared in such a way that it indexes not only the <i>List</i> but also the novel itself.<br><br>The purpose of allusion in a literary work is essentially the same as that of all other types of metaphor -- the development and revelation of character, structure, and theme -- and, when skillfully used, it does all of these simultaneously. Joyce's use of allusion is distinguished from that of other authors not by its purposes, but by its extent and thoroughness. <i>Ulysses</i> involves dozens of allusive contexts, all continually intersecting, modifying, and qualifying one another. Here again Joyce's uniqueness and complexity lie not in his themes or characters, nor in his basic methods of developing them, but in his accepting the challenge of an Olympian use of his chosen methods. The value of this volume to Joyce scholars and students is obvious; however, its usefulness to anyone who reads <i>Ulysses</i> is as great, if not greater. It can truly be the key to this difficult but rewarding novel.<br><br></p><p>"The hunt is on, a joy for the serendipitous, and an indispensable <i>omnium gatherum</i> for the reader of <i>Ulysses</i>. . . .

Ritual sacrifices were considered necessary for this propitiation and for maintaining a proper reciprocal relationship between humans and the supernatural world.</p><p>The essays in this book examine the archaeological evidence for ancient Peruvian sacrificial offerings of human beings, animals, and objects, as well as the cultural contexts in which the offerings occurred, from around 2500 B.C. until Inca times just before the Spanish Conquest. Major contributions come from the recent archaeological fieldwork of Steve Bourget, Anita Cook, and Alana Cordy-Collins, as well as from John Verano's laboratory work on skeletal material from recent excavations. Mary Frame, who is a weaver as well as a scholar, offers rich new interpretations of Paracas burial garments, and Donald Proulx presents a fresh view of the nature of Nasca warfare. Elizabeth Benson's essay provides a summary of sacrificial practices.</p></p><p>Elizabeth P.

The author's chief aim is to relate the book, not to Christians, but to Christ. Ellul thinks Christ is the center of all Scripture, and he also takes seriously the specific reference which Christ makes to the sign of Jonah. If this reading is correct, and the Bible is indeed a unity, the exposition of Ellul, though not developed in detail, has a distinctive theological contribution to make. / &#x201c;Those who want acute theological insight, and are not afraid of plain, hard-hitting application, will read this vivid study with relish and profit.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacques Ellul (1912&#x2013;&#x2019;1994), a French sociologist and lay theologian, was professor emeritus of law and of the history and sociology of institutions at the University of Bordeaux.

Lyn loves to hear from her readers and can be contacted via her website guestbook at: www.eclectics.com/lynstoneIn Victorian England, Jonathan Chadwick, a musical genius thought to be wickedly arrogant, tries to outwit gossip columnist Kathryn Wainwright, by pretending to be the idiot savant, Pip. Mix in a Stradivarius, a dead mother who left a painful legacy for her son, a lost fortune, some maiming, and a couple of villains, and there's plenty of potential diversion. While some of it pans out, the rest isn't so much diverting as dissonant. Take, for example, the main mistaken-identity premise: Watching Jonathan/Pip's relationship with Kathryn is downright discomfiting because Pip is more boy than man.

But the case is so explosive and the dead man s enemies inside the LAPD are so numerous that it falls to Harry to solve it. Now the streets are superheating. Harry s year-old Vegas marriage is unraveling. And the hunt for a killer is leading Harry to another high-profile LA murder case, one where every cop had a motive. The question is, did any have the guts?&#34;</p><p>Michael Connelly, whose novel <i>The Poet</i> won the 1997 Anthony Award for Best Mystery, is already recognized as one of the smartest and most vivid scribes of the hard-boiled police procedural. Now, with his much-anticipated sixth Harry Bosch novel, <i>Angels Flight</i>, Connelly offers one of the finest pieces of mystery writing to appear in 1998. Bosch is awakened in the middle of the night and, out of rotation, he is assigned to the murder investigation of the high-profile African American attorney Howard Elias. When Bosch arrives at the scene, it seems that almost the entire LAPD is present, including the IAD (the Internal Affairs Division). Elias, who made a career out of suing the police, was sadistically gunned down on the Angels Flight tram just as he was beginning a case that would have struck the core of the department; not surprisingly, L.A.'s men and women in blue become the center of the investigation. Haunted by the ghost of the L.A. riots, plagued by incessant media attention, and facing turmoil at home, Bosch suddenly finds himself questioning friends and associates while working side by side with some longtime enemies. <p> <i>Angels Flight</i> is a detective's nightmare scenario and is disturbingly relevant to the racially tense last decade of the 20th century. Amidst the twists and turns of his complex narrative, Connelly affirms his rightful place among the masters of contemporary mystery fiction. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Michael Connelly is a former journalist and author of the bestselling series of Harry Bosch novels and the bestselling novels Chasing the Dime, The Poet, Blood Work, and Void Moon.

Long relegated to boardroom or back room card table, the cigar has emerged into broad daylight, attaining mass appeal while holding on to its macho mystique. And amid the available (or not so available) assortment of cigars, the Havana stands head and shoulders above the rest. Grown on patches of land at the western tip of Cuba, cured, and rolled following centuries-old traditions, for decades illegal in the United States, it has a flavor -- and a cachet -- all its own.<p>After two years in Cuba researching the production of the cigar, Charles Del Todesco has pulled together a remarkable two-part testament to this legendary status symbol. In part one he reviews the hollowed history of cigars in Cuba, then describes in detail the processes involved in creating them.

Giotto di Bodone (1266-1337) was the most famous and influential painter of his generation in Italy. As the pioneer of modern painting, his impact was so enormous that his artist colleagues in Florence, however capable, were left struggling to keep up. His services were engaged by numerous high officials and princes, including the Pope and his cardinals, King Robert of Anjou, and the Scaligeri and Visconti. All these works, including the large secular cycles, are lost. Amongst his surviving works, his masterpieces are undoubtedly his decoration, from 1303 to 1305, of the private chapel built by the financier Enrico Scrovegni for his family in a former Roman amphitheatre in Padua, the fresco cycle in the Upper Church of Assisi, and the frescos in side chapels of Santa Croce in Florence. The simplicity and strength of his forms, as well as the humanism he infused in his works, set him apart from his Byzantine contemporaries and at the forefront of Italian painting in the early years of the Renaissance.</p></p><p>Basic Art titles feature: <br>� detailed chronological summary of the artist&#x2019;s life and work, covering the cultural and historical importance of the artist <br>� over 100 color illustrations with explanatory captions <br>� concise biographyNorbert Wolf has published books on medieval art, Piranesi, Vel�zquez and Romantic painting, including TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art titles on Vel�zquez, Kirchner, Friedrich, D�rer, and Holbein, and Codices Illustres: The World&#x2019;s Most Famous Illuminated Manuscripts.

These early socialists sought to reform, if not render extinct, the capitalism that they believed had wrought social upheaval and discontent. In several preliminary chapters, prepared as a prelude to a full-blown critique of nineteenth-century socialism, Mill seeks to understand the thrust of socialist theory and to appraise the impact of its potential implementation. These chapters, never before published in book form, were originally made public in the pages of the &#39;Forthightly Review&#39; in 1879.</p><p><b>JOHN STUART MILL&nbsp;</b>was born in London on May 20, 1806, the son of noted Scottish economist and philosopher James Mill, who held an influential post in the powerful East India Company. Mill's natural talent and physical stamina were put to the test at a very young age when he undertook a highly structured and individual�ized upbringing orchestrated by his father, who believed that the mind was a passive receptacle for human experience. His educa�tion and training were so intense that he was reading Greek at the age of three and doing independent writing at six.<br><br>Mill's education broadened considerably after 1823 when he entered the East India Company to commence his life's career as his father had done before him. He traveled, became politically involved, and in so doing moved away from the narrower sectar�ian attitudes in which he had been raised. His ideas and imagina�tion were ignited by the views of such diverse personalities as Wordsworth, Saint-Simon, Coleridge, Comte, and de Tocqueville.&nbsp;<br><br>During his life, Mill wrote many influential works:&nbsp;<i>System of Logic&nbsp;</i>(1843);&nbsp;<i>Principles of Political Economy&nbsp;</i>(1848); On&nbsp;<i>Liberty&nbsp;</i>(1859);&nbsp;<i>The Subjection of Women&nbsp;</i>(1861);&nbsp;<i>Utilitarianism&nbsp;</i>(1863);&nbsp;<i>Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy&nbsp;</i>(1865); and&nbsp;<i>Autobiography&nbsp;</i>(1873).<br><br>As a defender of individual freedom and human rights, John Stuart Mill lives on as a nineteenth-century champion of social reform.

In late 1997, world order has been destabilized by recession and extreme nationalism. The French foreign minister creates "EurCon," a European Confederation led by France and Germany that will rule Europe. EurCon's attempt to assimilate Eastern Europe meets with resistance, particularly from Poland, and soon the U.S. and Britain are pulled into the struggle. The war and its build-up are reported by various observers: the senior CIA field man in Moscow, the private advisor to the U.S. president, a French intelligence agent, a Hungarian police commander, a Russian intelligence man, a CIA economist (the lone woman and hence the "like" interest) and officers of the American, German and Polish armed forces. The French are definitely the bad guys here, albeit dim ones who don't see the writing on the wall when the Americans wipe out their nuclear capability two-thirds through the book. The prose serves the galloping plot and technology well, if humorlessly; maps, dramatis personae and a glossary also help.

His simple yet dynamic design style has greatly affected international furniture design and has made a significant contribution to the history of architecture. His unconventional approach and extraordinary furniture, hailed by Theo van Doesburg as &#39;the new sculpture&#39;, inspired many of his contemporaries just as it continues to inspire today&#39;s designers; he has he has been cited as a source of inspiration by designers ranging from Verner Panton to Konstantin Grcic. This detailed yet accessible monograph is structured chronologically and richly illustrated with photographs and sketches of Reitveld&#39;s furniture design and his twenty-odd architectural projects. Following Rietveld from his humble beginnings as a cabinet-maker to his final years as a world-renowned architect, this book will present both his lesser-known work and his most celebrated, such as &#34;The Zigzag Chair&#34; of 1934. One chapter focuses exclusively on the Schroder House of 1924, which is among the very few twentieth-century buildings to be accorded UNESCO World Heritage Monument status. Produced in collaboration with the Centraal Museum, which holds the world&#39;s largest collection of Rietveld&#39;s work, this book includes a number of never-before-published images of Rietveld&#39;s work and his life. Author Ida van Zijl, who is the Deputy Director of the Centraal Museum and who has organized a variety of exhibitions that have included Rietveld, gives a thorough, accessible account of Rietveld&#39;s life and his work. She also explores his significance in the wider context of avante-garde movements, such as his influence within De Stijl and Functionalism, and well as the lesser-known but equally interesting work he produced with an eye towards mass housing and industrial production. Designed by Wim Crowel, the best-known Dutch graphic designer, the book provides a rich mixture of beautiful images and a fascinating story. Most crucially, this book will give Rietveld the attention he has long deserved as a designer and architect, presenting a comprehensive coverage of his output and a full analysis of his achievements.</p><p>Ida van Zijl is deputy director of the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, the holder of the main collection of Rietveld's work. Since the late 1970s, she has studied Rietveld and has complete access not only to the museum's collection of documents, but also to those held by his family and friends. She was the editor of <i>Gerrit Rietveld: The Complete Works</i> (published in 1992), a catalogue of his work.'impressive ... engaging and highly accessible' Self Build &amp; Design 'Another beautifully produced monograph from Phaidon ... a great introduction to Rietveld's beautiful Modernist aesthetic' Grafik commenting on the fact that the book's designer, Wim Crouwel, is a former pupil at the Rietveld Academy, they add - [a] very handsome book. It displays an enviable lightness of touch, and is a good example of what happens when a designer really engages with his subject matter. We reckon Mr Rietveld would have been proud.'

Unlike the earlier oiled-and-posed demigods who graced the pages of the popular magazines of the day (Strength and Health, Muscle Power, Tomorrow�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s Man, The Young Physique and similar publications), Champion�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s handsome young models were a new breed. They were less often competitive bodybuilders and instead seemed more like the bad-boys-next-door that viewers secretly wanted to sneak a peak of in the locker room or fool around with under the bleachers. <br><br> Kundzicz�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s images were bold and iconoclastic in their use of costumes, uniforms, props and vivid color. These photographs became wildly popular with mail-order customers and collectors because they stood in stark contrast to most of the physique photography available at that time. While Champion was at its peak in the mid-1960s, Kundzicz launched and published his own magazines, including Big and Go Guys, expanding and strengthening the Champion brand. His ability to create and market these colorful, campy images of handsome young men assured him of a loyal fan base that continues to grow even today, a half century after most of his iconic images were created.<br><br> In his color photos of nude and semi-nude athletic men of the 50s and 60s, Walter Kundzicz pushed the societal taboos of his time and skirted the fringes of legality. In his Champion Studios he portrayed his toned and scantily clad models in delicate and playful postures that not only lived out and performed common homoerotic fantasies, but also perfectly captured the rigid but changing sexual climate in North America between the Kinsey report and hippy free love.<br><br> Today Kundzicz is considered one of the best photographers of his genre, with his prints becoming rare collectibles.<br><br> "Classic Male Nudes", Issue Two of GOLIATH WALLPAPER OF FAME, is dedicated to Walter Kundzicz�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s outstanding photographic work from this era, and includes a lifesized poster and nine XL-Posters, as well as an autobiographic text by Kundzicz himself.<br><br>"Goliath Wallpaper of Fame" is a unique poster book collectible with large-scale prints of outstanding photographs, paintings or illsutrations from different artists or movements. <br><br> Each issue includes interesting background information, for example, interviews and biographies, as well as nine XL- and one XXL-/lifesize poster.</p><p>Walter Kundzicz, born 1925, has been an Army Air Corps gunner, an architectural draftsman and �&#x20ac;&#x201c; under the studio names Champion, Take One, Master Physique and Treasure House of European Models (THEM) �&#x20ac;&#x201c; was one of the most prolific photographers of the male nude physique during the 1950s and 60s.

Behind me, my mother is elbow-deep in a giant bowl of flour and spices, gossiping to a neighbor, while four chickens roast over the fire. Out here, life is colder and grander. I creep up the marble staircase that rises before me like a giant ladder to Heaven, the banister smooth under my hand. I reach the landing and crouch in silence, but I heard Frederica leave earlier. She left behind a trace of her scent when she wafted down the elegant staircase, her special blend of roses and grace.<br> <br>I creep along the passageway and peek into Frederica&#x2019;s boudoir. If she were here, I might get a kiss and a bonbon, or a slap depending on her mood, but now the room is deserted. I enter and the plush carpet softens my steps. A painting of Monsieur Dumonceaux, who owns the house and Frederica and everything in it, looks down on me. Monsieur Dumonceaux is an old lover of my mother&#x2019;s, and he brought us to Paris and gave us our lodgings. He&#x2019;s not a lover anymore&#x2014;Frederica is now his lover&#x2014;but he is always kind to us, and Ma says he is a good man.<br> <br>His portrait watches over Frederica, but when she has a new guest, she asks the footman to cover it. The rest of her room is cozy and sumptuous: a fire still licking lazily in the hearth; a wardrobe so big I once slept in there, hidden for hours; crimson curtains hanging over the tall, airy windows; a marble table set with a decanter of a wonderful-smelling potion called brandy, which always makes me think of men and candy. I sniff at the little array of perfume bottles on her table then head to my destination: her bed with its layers of green silk sheets and heavy white furs, lace and velvet trimming the pillows. A mattress as soft as a dream welcomes me down in its embrace, so different from my pallet in the kitchen. I burrow under the heavy blankets and nestle in. Ma always says I am lazy, but I&#x2019;m not lazy, I think as I drift off to sleep, just . . . happy.<br> <br>&#x201c;And what have we here?&#x201d; says Frederica in her bright, charmed voice, the one she uses with Monsieur Dumonceaux and her other gentlemen. Frederica has dark, curling hair, and laughing blue eyes that can turn as cold and hard as gems. The man with her this evening is not Monsieur Dumonceaux but an older gentleman with watery eyes, wearing an orange coat that reminds me of the skin of a cat.<br> <br>I am sleepy and dreaming under the pile of furs. I smile up at Frederica, then at the man as well; Frederica&#x2019;s moods are always changing, but men are generally pleasant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Little scamp,&#x201d; says Frederica fondly, and tousles my hair. &#x201c;Now go on back to your mother, and tell her that Monsieur de Braque here will want a juicy chicken later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Such a charming child!&#x201d; declares the man, who must be the Monsieur de Braque who wants a juicy chicken. &#x201c;And what harm would there be, were she to stay?&#x201d; he asks, raising his brows at Frederica, as though making a joke, though I know he isn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, quiet, J�r�me,&#x201d; says Frederica, laughing and picking me up roughly. I avert my eyes from the man&#x2019;s gaze and struggle to pull down my dress that is now tangled around my waist. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s only a child.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ten?&#x201d; asks the man eagerly. &#x201c;How lovely she is!&#x201d;<br> <br>Seven, I want to protest, but I don&#x2019;t say anything, for suddenly I want to get out of the room and away from the man&#x2019;s watered green eyes. The color of scum on a pond, I think with a shudder, and squirm against Frederica to let me down. I hear the soft tinkle of her laughter, raindrops on smooth glass, and she pushes me out. &#x201c;Get back to the kitchens,&#x201d; she hisses before closing the door. &#x201c;Now, la, monsieur, to be so interrupted . . .&#x201d; I hear her say as she turns back to her evening entertainment.<br> <br>I lean against the door but the thick oak muffles the scene behind. I imagine what they will be doing, dogs rutting in the street that stay together, joined and panting, even after slops are thrown on them.<br> <br>Joined and panting, I think, traipsing languidly down the corridor now that Frederica is safe with her guest. I stand at the top of the staircase and imagine, for one moment, that the house is mine, and that Frederica is my mother and instead of sleeping in the kitchen that reeks of raw chicken and mold, I have a room next to Frederica&#x2019;s, and my own bed is as soft and glorious as hers.<br> <br>A few days later, another push, but this time out onto the streets. We hear Frederica shouting at Dumonceaux that I am a little tramp, tempting her clients, and claiming she has no more use for us. Ma loses her position as cook and now we have to leave the comfortable house and all her clients in the neighborhood who buy her chickens.<br> <br>&#x201c;Snozzle-faced bitch,&#x201d; complains my mother. We gather our belongings off the street and prepare for the long walk to my stepfather&#x2019;s house. My feet are bare, though it is cold out; I can&#x2019;t ruin my only pair of shoes in this mud.<br> <br>&#x201c;What sort of a woman is threatened by a seven-year-old child?&#x201d; Ma continues, spitting and glaring up at the impassive windows of the little house.<br> <br>A porter from next door watches us without curiosity. &#x201c;An angel in the making,&#x201d; he says, gesturing to me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be trouble all her life.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, dears, let&#x2019;s get going.&#x201d; Ma&#x2019;s lover, the monk Guimard, stands beside us in our distress. He leans over and hoists a sheet filled with heavy iron pots, my mother&#x2019;s treasure and trade. &#x201c;I never liked her, but at least Dumonceaux still does right by us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But how does he do right by us if we cannot live in his house anymore?&#x201d; I ask, but no one answers. I am dragging a basket filled with our clothes, vainly trying to avoid puddles and the deep mud as we start our journey. It will take us two hours at least to cross the city and already the October night is cold and the streets grim.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, aren&#x2019;t we a raggedy bunch!&#x201d; says the monk Guimard in his jolly way, always ready with a kind word or funny story. I wish he were my father, but whenever I say that my mother tells me to be quiet, or he will be arrested for indecency. &#x201c;Joseph and Mary without an inn,&#x201d; he continues, &#x201c;and with a little babe in arms. That&#x2019;s you, Jeanne. But time will be our friend; chickens are always in demand and your skills are beyond compare,&#x201d; he adds kindly to my mother, wobbling slightly under his burden as he steps over a dead dog.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ran�on will take us in,&#x201d; says Ma, carrying her enormous copper kettle and a heavy gridiron, referring to her husband and the man she says I must call father. &#x201c;And at least we don&#x2019;t have to worry about Jeanne.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you have to worry about me?&#x201d; I ask, jumping quickly out of the way as a magnificent six-horsed carriage roars by.<br> <br>&#x201c;Monsieur Dumonceaux has agreed to take on your education,&#x201d; my mother says.<br> <br>I stop. &#x201c;What do you mean, Ma?&#x201d; I ask, thinking, I don&#x2019;t know why, of the man&#x2019;s green watery eyes and the hungry way they devoured me.<br> <br>&#x201c;He has agreed to send you to a convent, where you&#x2019;ll be educated and even learn your letters. Imagine that!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A convent! Oh no!&#x201d; I cry, thinking of the convent on the corner of our street and the grim black-clad nuns that circle in the courtyard. Nothing goes in or out: What do they even eat?<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, now don&#x2019;t cry,&#x201d; says the monk Guimard kindly. &#x201c;Nuns can be dear ladies, I remember one particularly fine young novice when I was young&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhh,&#x201d; hisses Ma. &#x201c;You talk too much. It&#x2019;ll be the Bastille for you, one of these days. Careful&#x2014;I know that pig&#x2014;took a chunk of Madame Farg�&#x2019;s ankle last week.&#x201d; She pulls me away from a snortling boar that has started following us.<br> <br>I trundle on, crying now, because I don&#x2019;t want to disappear into a convent and leave Ma and the monk Guimard. And I may never see Frederica&#x2019;s room again, never burrow in her soft sheets, never be treated to butter bonbons and little drops of her scent. My fate has been decided, I think, sobbing openly now as we walk wearily through the dark streets. I am to go to a convent, and I&#x2019;m quite sure they won&#x2019;t have any satin sheets for me there.</p><h2>Don&#39;t Look Down</h2><p><p><em>The heat is on in Palm Beach-and Rick and Samantha are sizzling. </em></p><p>Samantha Jellicoe is no ordinary thief.

When the first client of her new security business is murdered, Sam is determined to find the killer. Now if only she can manage to stay out of jail, resist her former "associate's" lucrative job offers, and keep Rick from sticking his nose into her business, she might just manage to stay alive. Because trouble isn't just walking&#x2014;it's running&#x2014;to catch up with her. </p></p><p><p>A native and current resident of Southern California, Suzanne Enoch loves movies almost as much as she loves books. When she is not busily working on her next novel, Suzanne likes to contemplate interesting phenomena, like how the three guppies in her aquarium became 161 guppies in five months.</p>*Starred Review* Enoch introduced art thief Samantha Jellicoe and her British multibillionaire lover Rick Addison in <i>Flirting with Danger</i> (2005). Now the fearless, feisty, "semi-reformed" Samantha is back for a second caper, and so is long-suffering Rick. Having finally decided to leave her life of crime, Samantha goes into the security business. But being legitimate doesn't come easy. Samantha resents all of the unsolicited advice Rick offers, and Stoney, her partner, best friend, and fence, keeps trying to get her to return to the more lucrative life of crime. Plus, there's always the fear that a colleague from her former life, a police officer, or someone she's robbed, will show up at her office. Things aren't much better on the home front.

However, I love a man and many say this makes me an evil person.&#39; On 24 March 1962, when Emile Griffith stepped into the ring in Madison Square Garden to defend his world title against Benny Paret, he was filled with rage. During their weigh-in, the Cuban challenger had denounced Griffith as a &#39;faggot&#39; and minced towards him. In the macho world of boxing, where fighters know they are engaged in the hurt game, there could be no greater insult. At that time, it was illegal for people of the same gender to have sex, or even for a bar to knowingly serve a drink to a gay person. It was an insinuation that could have had dangerous consequences for Griffith - especially as it was true. In the fight that followed, Griffith pounded Paret into unconsciousness, and the Cuban would die soon after, leaving Griffith haunted by what he had done. Despite this, he went on to fight more world championship rounds than any other fighter in history in a career that lasted for almost 20 years. In Donald McRae&#39;s first sports book in more than a decade, he weaves a compelling tale of triumph over prejudice - Griffith was black, so doubly damned by contemporary society, but refused to cower away as society wished. A Man&#39;s World is a classic piece of sports writing.</p><p>Donald McRae is the award-winning author of eight books. He is one of only two authors to have won the prestigious William Hill award twice, for Dark Trade and In Black &amp; White.

The father was Alex&#39;s brother, Damien? And he&#39;s a coward. Seriously. I have no idea what her sister saw in him. Sarah blamed Alex and his whole family because she felt that Damien should have done what was right and married her. However, Sarah never knew that Damien was already married. Her sister knew, yet still had an affair. But before she found out, she completely hated that family. Sarah fought tooth and nail for her nephew, Nikos, or rather Nicky. Alex wanted to take that child cos he felt that Nikos should grow up in luxury. Of course, Sarah didn&#39;t want it and came up with what she thought was the perfect plan to get Alex to back off. She told him that if he wanted Nikos, he had to marry her. Unfortunately, as you can guess, her plan backfired. Alex agreed. Albeit extremely reluctant. Gosh, that guy is mean, I&#39;ll say more later! So basically they got married. They realised they were super attracted to each other, or rather Alex helped Sarah realise their attraction. I think you know what comes next. Yes, they fall in love and have a HEA. Alex is a jerk sometimes. A jerk who has an overly inflated view of himself. Of course, Sarah helps to burst that bubble. I mean, sure Alex is hot and all, make that really really hot! :D But what he said to Sarah on several occasions, just made me want to hit him. Seriously, it was just so mean to her. He just accused her of a lot of stuff, right after they made love for the first time. I mean, gosh, you really want to say all those things, you can wait till the next day right? But no, just because he was afraid of the emotions and thoughts she brought to him, he had to insult her and scold her. Gah. I felt like hitting him sometimes. Seriously. Oh oh oh! She hit him! Once! he deserved that one.

But the consummate artistry of Jane Austen (1775&#x2013;1817) transformed this effervescent tale of rural romance into a witty, shrewdly observed satire of English country life that is now regarded as one of the principal treasures of English language.<br>In a remote Hertfordshire village, far off the good coach roads of George III's England, a country squire of no great means must marry off his five vivacious daughters. At the heart of this all-consuming enterprise are his headstrong second daughter Elizabeth Bennet and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy &#x2014; two lovers whose pride must be humbled and prejudices dissolved before the novel can come to its splendid conclusion.<br>A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. Large print edition.</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

With skillful prose, he enthralls even as he horrifies; with uncanny insight, he disturbs as profoundly as he reveals. Evoking revulsion and admiration, anticipation and dread, Barker&#39;s works explore the darkest contradictions of the human condition: our fear of life and our dreams of death.</p><p>Clive Barker was born in Liverpool in 1952. His earlier books include The Books of Blood, Cabal, and The Hellbound Heart. In addition to his work as a novelist and playwright, he also illustrates, writes, directs and produces for stage and screen. His films include Hellraiser, Hellbound, Nightbreed and Candyman. Clive lives in Beverly Hills, California<b>Chapter One: The Truth</b> <p> Of all the rash and midnight promises made in the name of love, none, Boone now knew, was more certain to be broken than <i>"I'll never leave you."</i> </p><p> What time didn't steal from under your nose, circumstance did. It was useless to hope otherwise, useless to dream that the world somehow meant you good. Everything of value, everything you clung to for your sanity, would rot or be snatched in the long run, and the abyss would gape beneath you, as it gaped for Boone now, and suddenly, without so much as a breath of explanation, you were gone. Gone to hell or worse, professions of love and all. </p><p> His outlook hadn't always been so pessimistic. There'd been a time -- not all that long ago -- when he'd felt the burden of his mental anguish lifting. There'd been fewer psychotic episodes, fewer days when he felt like slitting his wrists rather than enduring the hours till his next medication. There'd seemed to be a chance for happiness. </p><p> It was that prospect that had won the declaration of love from him, that <i>"I'll never leave you,"</i> whispered in Lori's ear as they lay in the narrow bed he'd never dared hope would hold two. The words had not come in the throes of high passion. Their love life, like so much else between them, was fraught with problems. But where other women had given up on him, unforgiving of his failure, she'd persevered, told him there was plenty of time to get it right, all the time in the world. I'm with you for as long as you want me to be, her patience had seemed to say. </p><p> Nobody had ever offered such a commitment, and he wanted to offer one in return. Those words -- "I'll never leave you" -- were it. </p><p> The memory of them, and of her skin almost luminous in the murk of his room, and of the sound of her breathing when she finally fell asleep beside him -- all of it still had the power to catch his heart, and squeeze it till it hurt. </p><p> He longed to be free of both the memory and the words, now that circumstance had taken away any hope of their fulfillment. But they wouldn't be forgotten. They lingered on to torment him with his frailty. His meager comfort was that <i>she</i> -- knowing what she must now know about him -- would be working to erase her memory; and that with time she'd succeed. He only hoped she'd understand his ignorance of himself when he'd voiced that promise. He'd never have risked this pain if he'd doubted health was finally within his grasp. </p><p> Dream on! </p><p> Decker had brought an abrupt end to those delusions, the day he'd locked the office door, drawn the blinds on the Alberta spring sunshine, and said, in a voice barely louder than a whisper: </p><p> "Boone, I think we're in terrible trouble, you and I." </p><p> He was trembling, Boone saw, a fact not easily concealed in a body so big. Decker had the physique of a man who sweated out the day's angst in a gym. Even his tailored suits, always charcoal, couldn't tame his bulk. It had made Boone edgy at the start of their work together; he'd felt intimidated by the doctor's physical and mental authority. Now it was the fallibility of that strength he feared. Decker was a Rock; he was Reason; he was Calm. This anxiety ran counter to all he knew about the man. </p><p> "What's wrong?" Boone asked. </p><p> "Sit, will you? Sit and I'll tell you." </p><p> Boone did as he was told. In this office, Decker was lord. The doctor leaned back in the leather chair and inhaled through his nose, his mouth sealed in a downward curve. </p><p> "Tell me..." Boone said. </p><p> "Where to start." </p><p> "Anywhere." </p><p> "I thought you were getting better," Decker said, "I really did. We <i>both</i> did." </p><p> "I still am," Boone said. </p><p> Decker made a small shake of his head. He was a man of considerable intellect, but little of it showed on his tightly packed features, except perhaps in his eyes, which at the moment were not watching the patient, but were fixed on the table between them. </p><p> "You've started to talk in your sessions," Decker said, "about crimes you think you've committed. Do you remember any of that?" </p><p> "You know I don't." The trances Decker put him in were too profound. "I only remember when you play the tape back." </p><p> "I won't be playing any of these," Decker said. "I erased them." </p><p> "Why?" </p><p> "Because...I'm afraid, Boone. For you." He paused. "Maybe for both of us." </p><p> The crack in the Rock was opening and there was nothing Decker could do to conceal it. </p><p> "What <i>are</i> these crimes?" Boone asked, his words tentative. </p><p> "Murders. You talk about them obsessively. At first I thought they were dream crimes. You always had a violent streak in you." </p><p> "And now?" </p><p> "Now I'm afraid you may have actually committed them." </p><p> There was a long silence while Boone studied Decker, more in puzzlement than anger. The blinds had not been pulled all the way down. A slice of sunlight fell across him, and onto the table between them. On the glass surface was a bottle of still water, two tumblers, and a large envelope. Decker leaned forward and picked it up. </p><p> "What I'm doing now is probably a crime in itself," he told Boone. "Patient confidentiality is one thing, protecting a killer is another. But part of me is still hoping to God it isn't true. I want to believe I've succeeded. <i>We've</i> succeeded. Together. I want to believe you're well." </p><p> "I <i>am</i> well." </p><p> In lieu of reply Decker tore open the envelope. </p><p> "I'd like you to look at these for me," he said, sliding his hand inside and bringing out a sheaf of photographs to meet the light. </p><p> "I warn you, they're not pleasant." </p><p> He laid them on his reflection, turned for Boone's perusal. His warning had been well advised. The picture on the top of the pile was like a physical assault. Faced with it a fear rose in him he'd not felt since being in Decker's care: that the image might <i>possess</i> him. He'd built walls against that superstition, brick by brick, but they shook now, and threatened to fall. </p><p> "It's just a picture." </p><p> "That's right," Decker replied, "it's just a picture. What do you see?" </p><p> "A dead man." </p><p> "A murdered man." </p><p> "Yes. A murdered man." </p><p> Not simply murdered: butchered. The life slashed from him in a fury of slices and stabs, his blood flung on the blade that had taken out his neck, taken off his face, onto the wall behind him. He wore only his shorts, so the wounds on his body could be easily counted, despite the blood. Boone did just that now, to keep the horror from overcoming him. Even here, in this room where the doctor had chiseled another self from the block of his patient's condition, Boone had never choked on terror as he choked now. He tasted his breakfast in the back of his throat, or the meal the night before, rising from his bowels against nature. Shit in his mouth, like the dirt of his deed. </p><p> <i>Count the wounds,</i> he told himself, pretend they're beads on an abacus. Three, four, five in the abdomen and chest: one in particular ragged, more like a tear than a wound, gaping so wide the man's innards poked out. On the shoulder, two more. And then the face, unmade with cuts. So many their numbers could not be calculated, even by the most detached of observers. They left the victim beyond recognition: eyes dug out, lips slit off, nose in ribbons. </p><p> "Enough?" Decker said, as if the question needed asking. </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "There's a lot more to see." </p><p> He uncovered the second, laying the first beside the pile. This one was of a woman, sprawled on a sofa, her upper and lower body twisted in a fashion life would have forbidden. Though she was presumably not a relation of the first victim, the butcher had created a vile resemblance. Here was the same liplessness, the same eyelessness. Born from different parents, they were siblings in death, destroyed by the same hand. </p><p> <i>And am I their father?</i> Boone found himself thinking. </p><p> <i>"No,"</i> was his gut's response. <i>"I didn't do this."</i> </p><p> But two things prevented him from voicing his denial. First, he knew that Decker would not be endangering his patient's equilibrium this way unless he had good reason to do so. Second, denial was valueless when both of them knew how easily Boone's mind had deceived itself in the past. If he was responsible for these atrocities, there was no certainty he'd know it. </p><p> Instead he kept his silence, not daring to look up at Decker for fear he'd see the Rock shattered. </p><p> "Another?" Decker said. </p><p> "If we must." </p><p> "We must." </p><p> He uncovered a third photograph, and a fourth, laying the pictures out on the table like cards at a tarot reading, except that every one was Death. In the kitchen, lying at the open door of the refrigerator. In the bedroom, beside the lamp and the alarm. At the top of the stairs, at the window. The victims were of every age and color: men, women, and children. Whatever fiend was responsible, he cared to make no distinction. He simply erased life wherever he found it. Not quickly, not efficiently. The rooms in which these people had died bore plain testament to how the killer, in his humor, had toyed with them. Furniture had been overturned as they stumbled to avoid the coup de grace, blood prints left on walls and paintwork. One had lost his fingers to the blade, snatching at it perhaps; most had lost their eyes. But none had escaped, however brave their resistance. They'd all fallen at last, tangled in their underwear, or seeking refuge behind a curtain. Fallen sobbing, fallen retching. </p><p> There were eleven photographs in all. Every one was different, but also the same: all pictures of a madness performed, taken with the actor already departed. </p><p> God almighty, was <i>he</i> that man? </p><p> Not having an answer for himself, he asked the question of the Rock, speaking without looking up from the shining cards. </p><p> "Did I do this?" he said. </p><p> He heard Decker sigh, but there was no answer forthcoming, so he chanced a glance at his accuser. As the photographs had been laid out before him, he'd felt the man's scrutiny like a crawling ache in his scalp. But now he once more found that gaze averted. </p><p> "Please tell me," he said. "Did I do this?" </p><p> Decker wiped the moist purses of ski...</p></p><h2>Brown Sugar: Eighty Years of American Black Female Superstars</h2><p>Explores the lives, careers, private thoughts, and public images of legendary Black singers and actresses whose talent and beauty won acclaim</p><p></p><h2>The Fountain</h2><p>What if you could live forever? <i>The Fountain</i> is an odyssey about a man's thousand-year struggle to save the woman he loves. In three separate lives&#x2014;Tomas the conquistador, Tommy the scientist, and Tom the explorer&#x2014;Thomas is driven to discover the mysteries of life; all three stories converge into one truth as he comes to terms with life, death, love, and rebirth. The book is an extension of Aronofsky's cinematic vision, and will contain production stills of the film's stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, original script, original art, and observations from creators Ari Handel and Darren Aronofsky. Edited by Darren Aronofsky, <i>The Fountain</i> is not so much a tie-in or a behind-the-scenes look at the film, but rather a thoughtful meditation on the film's provocative themes of life and death and its singular visuals.</p><p>Often hailed as renowned director Stanley Kubrick's heir apparent, <b>Darren Aronofsky</b>'s directorial debut <i>Pi</i> won the Director's Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, Independent Spirit Award, and the Open Palm. His follow up, <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>, captivated both fans and critics alike. <i>The Fountain</i> is a Warner Bros. Pictures and Regency Enterprises film. It will be released domestically by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment company.When his plans for the ambitious, millennia--spanning fantasy film <i>The Fountain </i>were derailed, <i>Pi</i> and <i>Requiem for a Dream</i> director<i></i>Aronofsky recast the story as a graphic novel, and although the movie was subsequently revived (starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz; it's due out later this year), the comics version stayed on track. Its three parallel stories, set in sixteenth-century Central America, the present day, and the distant future, respectively, depict the same man as a conquistador, a scientist, and an interplanetary explorer, always trying to prevent the death of the woman he desperately loves. Aronofsky's epic boldly blends mysticism and science, which coalesce in the hero's discovery of the mythical Tree of Life. Williams' lush, painted artwork, stylistically and narratologically reminiscent of <i>Sandman </i>illustrator Dave McKean's work, perfectly matches the script's passion and challenging abstruseness. Not simply an adaptation of the movie--the screenplay that is its basis being significantly altered when the film project was revived--the lavish, oversize graphic novel ought to be fascinating to compare with the released movie. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The Harvard Trotsky Archive was opened to researchers in 1980. In it, researchers found evidence that Leon Trotsky deliberately lied many times and about many people and events. Other evidence of Trotsky's lies comes from his own writings and in documents from former Soviet archives. Drawing upon primary sources from the Harvard Trotsky Archive and from former Soviet archives Grover Furr subjects the testimony of Moscow Trials defendants to a source-critical check and verification. His conclusion: their testimony is genuine, reflecting what the defendants chose to say. The same primary sources, plus Trotsky's own writings, demonstrate that Trotsky lied about virtually everything concerning the Soviet Union in his writings about the three Moscow Trials of 1936, 1937 and 1938, his writings on the assassination of Sergei Kirov, and in his testimony to the Dewey Commission in 1937. This book will revolutionize the understanding of the Moscow Trials. Trotsky's writings and activities during the 1930s must be seen in an entirely new light. The results of this research reveal much about Trotsky's conspiracies in the 1930s.</p><p></p><h2>Now and Then (Thorndike Press Large Print Core Series)</h2><p>When a simple case turns into a treacherous and politically charged investigation, Spenser faces his most difficult challenge yet-keeping his cool while his beloved Susan Silverman is in danger. Spenser knows something&#39;s amiss the moment Dennis Doherty walks into his office. The guy&#39;s aggressive yet wary, in the way men frightened for their marriages always are. So when Doherty asks Spenser to investigate his wife Jordan&#39;s abnormal behavior, Spenser agrees. A job&#39;s a job, after all. Not surprisingly, Spenser catches Jordan with another man, tells Dennis what he&#39;s found out, and considers the case closed. But a couple of days later, all hell breaks loose, and three people are dead. This isn&#39;t just a marital affair gone bad. Spenser is in the middle of hornet&#39;s nest of trouble, and he&#39;s got to get out of it without getting stung. With Hawk watching his back, and gun-for- hire Vinnie Morris providing extra cover, Spenser delves into a complicated and far-reaching ope</p><p><b>Robert B. Parker</b> is the author of more than fifty books. He lives in Boston.In this thirty-fifth book in the Spenser series, Parker revisits some old history. After Spenser is hired to tail a clients wife, hes uncomfortably reminded of his own past problems with his longtime love, Susan. As he digs up the paramours history, Spenser must reconcile his own feelings about Susan while bringing another villain to justice. The plot takes on an international perspective when the cheating wife leads Spenser to a group involved in procuring weapons and recruits for terrorist activities. Joe Mantegna delivers a solid performance. Its easy to picture him as Spenser since he has played the role on A&amp;E. He doesnt do as well with some of the female voices, but hes a cool performer nonetheless.

Its bricks had once been red, but years of grime and pollution had darkened them to a brownish&#x2013;grey. The outer wall was topped with ragged coils of razor wire. The wire was rusted and full of holes that hadn&#x2019;t been repaired in years, as if the owners had decided that they couldn&#x2019;t keep the burglars out but might at least be able to give them tetanus on the way in.</p><p>The rest of the dead&#x2013;end street was dark, empty&#x2013;looking buildings and shops hiding behind steel security gratings. The gratings were covered in graffiti and it was hard to tell whether the businesses locked behind them were still open or whether they&#x2019;d been abandoned too. The only shop that looked in good shape carried the triple&#x2013;sphere sign of a pawnbroker&#x2019;s. Behind the shops and factory was the sort of council estate where the muggers use broken bottles because they can&#x2019;t afford knives.</p><p>It was only eleven o&#x2019;clock and the rest of London was filled with the sounds of the city, but on the street nothing moved. The road was empty except for parked cars. Half of them were missing wheels, windows, or both, and none would have looked out of place in a junkyard&#x2014;except for the minivan parked at the top of the street. Its polished black paint melted into the shadows, with the orange glow from the streetlights picking out the silver hubcaps and lights along with the Mercedes symbol mounted on the grill. I rolled my eyes when I saw it. My senses told me there was no immediate danger but I stayed in the shadows of the alley and scanned the street for another minute before walking out towards the van.</p><p>Most of the streetlights were broken and the ones still working were patchy. I walked the street&#x2019;s length cloaked in darkness, with only the occasional circle of orange piercing the gloom. Looking over my shoulder I could see the pillars of light of the Canary Wharf skyscrapers, visible over the rooftops. We were close to the river, even if I couldn&#x2019;t see it, and as I walked I heard the mournful sound of a boat&#x2019;s horn echoing off the water. Ragged clouds covered most of the sky, their cover blending with the glow of the streetlights to hide the stars.</p><p>As I reached the van one of the front windows slid down, and the street was quiet enough that I could hear the purr of the motor. I stopped by the door and looked at the man sitting inside. &#x201c;Could you possibly have made it any more obvious?&#x201d;</p><p>My name is Alex Verus. I&#x2019;m a mage, a diviner. In mage terms I&#x2019;m unaligned, which means I&#x2019;m not affiliated with the Council (the main Light power block) but don&#x2019;t count myself as a Dark mage either. Although I&#x2019;m not part of the Council I do freelance jobs for them, like this one. The man in the passenger seat to whom I was talking was my contact with the Council, a mage named Talisid, and he gave me a patient nod. &#x201c;Verus.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good to see you.&#x201d; I looked the van up and down. &#x201c;Seriously, a Mercedes? Did you get it waxed, too?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re concerned about stealth,&#x201d; Talisid said, &#x201c;perhaps we shouldn&#x2019;t be talking in the open?&#x201d;</p><p>Talisid is a man in his forties, shorter than average, with greying hair receding from a balding head. He always seems to be wearing the same understated business suit, but with a sort of steadiness that suggests he might be more than meets the eye. I&#x2019;d met him in the spring, at a ball in Canary Wharf where he&#x2019;d offered me a job. Things didn&#x2019;t exactly go to plan, but Talisid had held up his end of the bargain, and when he&#x2019;d asked for my help tonight I&#x2019;d agreed. I stepped back and watched as the passengers piled out of the van. Talisid was first and following him was a tall, thin man with a long face like a greyhound, who gave me a nod. His name was Ilmarin, an air mage. I didn&#x2019;t recognise the next three but I hadn&#x2019;t expected to; their guns marked them as Council security.</p><p>&#x201c;Still planning to take the lead?&#x201d; Talisid asked me quietly as the security team went through their preparations, checking rifles and headsets.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m here for.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s also what <i>they&#x2019;re </i>here for,&#x201d; Talisid pointed out. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s their line of work.&#x201d;</p><p>I almost smiled. When Talisid had called me yesterday and given me the briefing, he&#x2019;d assumed I&#x2019;d be staying at the tail end of the formation, maybe all the way back in the van. He was offering me another chance to back out. But there was another message in there too, which wasn&#x2019;t so funny: the security men were expendable and I wasn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to be much use from a hundred yards back,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you all the warning you need, but I need a good view.&#x201d;</p><p>Talisid held up a hand in surrender. &#x201c;All right. You&#x2019;ll be on point with Garrick. We&#x2019;ll move on your signal.&#x201d;</p><p>The man Talisid had nodded towards was the one who&#x2019;d been in the driver&#x2019;s seat, now standing a little apart from the others. He was tall, with short sandy hair and an athlete&#x2019;s build, strong and fast. He was wearing black body armour with a high&#x2013;tech look, along with dark combat fatigues, black gloves and boots, and a webbing belt that held a handgun, a machine pistol, a knife, and half a dozen metal cylinders that looked suspiciously like grenades. A second pistol rested in an ankle holster, and he carried a weapon in a sling that looked like a cross between a submachine gun and an assault rifle. He watched me with calm blue eyes as I walked up. &#x201c;Garrick?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>Garrick nodded and spoke in a deep voice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the layout?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you once we get inside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Going with Talisid?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With you.&#x201d;</p><p>Garrick raised an eyebrow and looked me up and down. I was wearing combat trousers, black sneakers, a belt with a few things hooked into it, and a light fleece. If Garrick looked like something out of a military thriller, I looked like an amateur camper. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m flattered,&#x201d; Garrick said, &#x201c;but you&#x2019;re not my type.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m your recon,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nice,&#x201d; Garrick said. &#x201c;You can do it from the van.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to be in the van.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is a combat mission,&#x201d; Garrick said patiently. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time to babysit.&#x201d;</p><p>A lot of people think diviners are useless in a fight. All in all it helps me more than it hurts me, but it&#x2019;s still a bit of a nuisance when you want to be taken seriously. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be the one doing the babysitting,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Those guns won&#x2019;t do much good if this thing takes your head off from behind.&#x201d;</p><p>I expected Garrick to get annoyed but he only gave me a look of mild inquiry. &#x201c;What are you going to do? Punch it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to tell you exactly where it is and what it&#x2019;s doing,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you can&#x2019;t figure out a way to beat this thing with that going for you, then you can back off and let us handle it.&#x201d;</p><p>Garrick studied me a moment longer, then shrugged. &#x201c;Your funeral.&#x201d; He turned to the other men. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s move.&#x201d;</p><p>The inside of the factory was pitch&#x2013;black. The power had been turned off a long time ago and the lights that hadn&#x2019;t been smashed or lost their bulbs were dark. Corridors were cluttered with old machinery and pieces of junk that had been piled up and left to decay, forcing us to pick a winding path through the obstacles and making it difficult to get a clear line of sight. The air smelt of dust and rusted metal.</p><p>The creature we were hunting was called a barghest: a shapeshifter that can take the form of either a human or a great wolflike dog. They&#x2019;ve got preternatural speed and strength, and they&#x2019;re difficult to detect with normal or magical senses. Or so the stories say; I&#x2019;ve never met one. But all the sources agreed that the creatures killed with claws and teeth, making these sort of dark, cramped quarters the absolute worst place to fight one. There were too many possible hiding places, too many ways the creature could lie in wait to attack from behind.</p><p>Of course, that was the reason Talisid had brought me along.</p><p>To my eyes, the factory existed on two levels. There was the present, a world of darkness and shadow, broken only by the torches in my hand and on Garrick&#x2019;s rifle, looming obstacles blocking our path and the threat of danger around every corner. But overlaid upon that was a second world, a branching web of lines of glowing white light, the web branching over and over again through four dimensions, multiplying into thousands and millions of thinning wisps, every one a possible future. The futures of the corridor and the objects within it were fixed and solid, while my and Garrick&#x2019;s futures were a constantly shifting web, flickering and twisting with every moment.</p><p>Looking through the futures I saw my possible actions, and their consequences. I saw myself stepping on the loose piece of scrap metal in front of me, saw myself tripping and falling, and corrected my movements to avoid it. As I did, the future in which I fell thinned to nothingness, never to exist, and the futures of me stepping around it brightened in its place. By seeing the future, I decided; as I decided, the future changed, and new futures replaced those never to happen. To anyone watching, it looks like pure fluke; every step in the right place, every hazard avoided without seeming to notice. But the obstacles were just a detail. Most of my attention was on the near and middle future, watching for the flurry of movement and weapons fire that would signal an attack. As long as I was paying attention, nothing in this factory could surprise us; long before anything got into position for an ambush, I could see it and give warning.</p><p>This was why Talisid had wanted me along. Just by being here, I could bring the chances of things going seriously wrong down to almost zero. Knowledge can&#x2019;t win a battle, but it&#x2019;s one hell of a force multiplier.</p><p>Something caught my attention as we passed through a doorway, and I signalled for Garrick to stop. He gave me a look but held up his hand and I heard the main body of the group halt behind us. I crouched and brushed a hand across the dusty floor, feeling the chill of the concrete.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Garrick said at last.</p><p>&#x201c;Someone forced this door,&#x201d; I said, keeping my voice quiet. &#x201c;Not long ago either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could have been the barghest.&#x201d;</p><p>I held up a broken link of chain. The outside was rusted but the edge where it had been broken glinted in Garrick&#x2019;s torch. &#x201c;Not unless our barghest uses bolt cutters.&#x201d;</p><p>Garrick raised an eyebrow and we moved on. I didn&#x2019;t mention the second thing that had been out of place: The rest of the chain had been taken away.</p><p>We moved deeper into the factory. Garrick and I were on point with two of the security men ten paces behind. Talisid and Ilmarin walked in the centre of the formation, the last of the Council security bringing up the rear. When I sensed that the barghest was near, I was to withdraw and let the mages and soldiers move up into a combat formation, ready to take it by surprise. At least, that was the plan.</p><p>Things weren&#x2019;t going to plan. By now I should have sensed where and how the fight was going to start. Looking forward into the future, I could see us searching every room of the factory, yet there wasn&#x2019;t any sign of combat. In fact, I couldn&#x2019;t see <i>any </i>future in which <i>any </i>of us got into combat. I could feel the men behind us growing tense; they knew something was wrong. The only one who seemed unconcerned was Garrick, radiating relaxed confidence. Had Talisid&#x2019;s information been wrong? He&#x2019;d been certain this was the place . . .</p><p>Around the next corner was a bigger room with a high ceiling and again I signalled for the others to stop. I closed my eyes and concentrated. Searching for combat wasn&#x2019;t working. Instead I started following the paths of our group through the timeline, looking to see what we would find. Something in the next chamber would occupy everyone&#x2019;s attention, and I looked more closely to see what it was . . .</p><p>And suddenly I knew why there wasn&#x2019;t going to be any fighting tonight. I straightened with a noise of disgust and called back to Talisid, no longer making any effort to keep my voice down. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bust.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a pause, then I heard Talisid answer. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We came here for nothing,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Somebody beat us to it.&#x201d; I walked around the corner and out onto the factory floor.</p><p>Most of the machinery on the floor looked to have been removed or cannibalised for parts long ago, but a few pieces were still rusting in the gloom, piles of rubbish in between. My torch cast only a weak glow in the darkness, the beam of light disappearing up into the wide open ceiling, and my footsteps echoed in the silence as I picked my way through broken boards and half&#x2013;full plastic bags. The smell of dust and old metal was stronger here, this time with something underneath it that made my nose twitch.</p><p>The barghest was lying in the centre of the room, and it was dead. With its life gone, it looked like a grey&#x2013;brown dog, big but not unnaturally so. It was lying on its side, eyes closed, with no blood or visible wounds. There was no smell of decay; it obviously hadn&#x2019;t been there long.</p><p>The others moved up into the room, following me. Garrick came up to my side. Although his weapon was lowered, his eyes kept moving, checking the corners and upper levels of the room. Only once he&#x2019;d swept the area did he look down at the body. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t look like much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not any more it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d;</p><p>The next two security men reached us, followed by Talisid and Ilmarin, and we formed a circle around the creature. They made a lot more noise than Garrick, as if they didn&#x2019;t know where to place their feet. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Talisid said at last.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s dead?&#x201d; Ilmarin asked me.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not getting up any time in the next few years,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Correct me if I&#x2019;m wrong,&#x201d; Garrick said, &#x201c;but I thought the mission was to kill this thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like someone else had the same idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t find any wounds,&#x201d; Ilmarin said. Air mages are great at sensing movement but not so good with objects. &#x201c;Verus, any idea what killed it?&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d been looking through the futures of me searching the body of this thing, watching myself rolling it over and running my hands through its fur. All I&#x2019;d found was that it was heavy and smelt bad. Actually, I didn&#x2019;t need my magic to notice that it smelt bad. &#x201c;No wounds, no blood. Looks like it just dropped dead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Death magic?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe. Anything from the living family could do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Talisid had been studying the body; now he looked at me. &#x201c;Is there any danger in splitting up?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked through the futures for a few seconds, then shook my head. &#x201c;This place is a graveyard. The only way anyone&#x2019;s going to get hurt is if they fall off the catwalks.&#x201d;</p><p>Talisid nodded and turned to the others. &#x201c;Spread out and search in pairs. Look for anything unusual.&#x201d; Although he didn&#x2019;t raise his voice, there was a note of command that assumed he would be obeyed. &#x201c;Check in every ten minutes and we&#x2019;ll meet back here in an hour.&#x201d;</p><p>Somehow or other I ended up with Garrick. We worked our way through the factory&#x2019;s ground floor, searching methodically.</p><p>The bodies of the barghest&#x2019;s victims were in a side room off from the factory floor. There were seven, in varying states of decay. I didn&#x2019;t look too closely.</p><p>&#x201c;Had an appetite,&#x201d; Garrick remarked once we&#x2019;d left the room and calle...</p></p><h2>Prentice Hall Literature the American Experience</h2><p>Prentice Hall Literature: The American Experience</p><p></p><h2>Auras And Chakras - Harnessing The Energy Within</h2><p>This ook presents an easy-to-understand view of how to harness energy from auras and chakras to realize full potential.</p><p></p><h2>Squirrel Dog Basics: A Guide to Hunting Squirrels With Dogs</h2><p>Treetop Publications is proud to introduce Squirrel Dog Basics-a book by David Osborn.

A series of events takes her to a house in the West Country and the blossoming of an English spring into which war only occasionally intrudes. Here she may find peace; here she will no longer be part of the furniture.</p><p>The heroine of Mary Wesley's latest novel, <i>Part of the Furniture</i>, is 17- year-old Juno Marlowe, a girl possessed of both extraordinary innocence and remarkable courage. We first meet Juno during the World War II blitz of London; she is suffering the twin effects of rape and having to sleep next to a dead stranger during an air raid. Other novelists might have chosen to plumb these traumatic events for several chapters at least, but Wesley gives them no more time than she thinks they deserve and then moves quickly on to the heart of her story, which takes Juno far away to the western corner of England to deliver a letter from the dead man to his family. Here Juno meets the stranger's father, a man considerably older than herself, and finds her soulmate. <p> If there's such a thing as a steely-eyed romantic, Mary Wesley is one. On the one hand, she deals with death, rape, and other horrors with unsentimental straightforwardness and humor as black as a coal cellar; on the other, she is a firm believer in love's ability to heal even the deepest wounds. The pleasure of reading <i>Part of the Furniture</i> is observing this surprising marriage of love and pragmatism, as well as the unexpected twists and turns Wesley throws into her tale of loving during wartime.</p>"A novel whose freshness of tone, energy of plotting and sweet nature make it exceptional by any standards" <br>-Eliza Charlton, <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> <p>"Few novelists offer such a rich concoction of amoral spice and cleverness; but to judge her work exlusively on this level is to miss more subtle rewards"<br>-Elizabeth Buchan, <i>Mail on Sunday</i></p> <p>"With its brilliant final twist, this is Mary Wesley's best yet"<br>-Katie Campbell, <i>Evening Standard</i></p></p><h2>The Healing Mind: You Can Cure Yourself Without Drugs</h2><p>QUALITY USED BOOK</p><p></p><h2>They Shall Expel Demons: What You Need to Know About Demons - Your Invisible Enemies</h2><p>What you need to know about demons.Do you have struggles that never go away?

Here is its story from the inside--a story filled with drama, humor, danger, compassion, and, of course, glorious music.<br><br>A player who studies and performs the exalted string-quartet repertoire has opted for a very special life. Arnold Steinhardt, tracing his own development as a student, orchestra player, and budding young soloist, gives a touching account of how he and his intrepid colleagues were converted to chamber music despite the daunting odds against success. And he reveals, as no one has before, the intensely difficult process by which--on the battlefield of daily three-hour rehearsals--four individualists master and then overcome the confining demands of ensemble playing. <br></p><p>Chamber-music lovers will rejoice in this story of the formation, nurturing, and maturing of the Guarneri String Quartet. First violinist Arnold Steinhardt has written a delightful memoir that radiates the love of music and sense of mutual respect and affection that have kept the Guarneri's players together since the ensemble was founded in 1964. How a famous, extremely busy musician learned to write so well is a mystery, but Steinhardt's style is as engaging and captivating as his playing. After sketching his own and his colleagues' pre-quartet careers, he describes how they choose and rehearse their repertoire and how they resolve their inevitable disagreements--and he even throws light on the inexplicable magic that happens in performance. Steinhardt recounts the pleasures and hardships of traveling and the group's partnership with illustrious guests (notably pianist Artur Rubinstein); he tells musical and personal anecdotes, wryly poking fun at himself and others, but never saying a malicious or derogatory word about anyone. Most remarkably, his discussions of a score are illuminating without becoming too technical. Steinhardt describes the emotional impact of music with a strikingly felicitous, often poetic touch, yet his characterizations resonate with his own experience and avoid the overblown or extravagant. Though it helps to know the music he feels so strongly about, this is a book anyone can enjoy. <i>--Edith Eisler</i>Arnold Steinhardt is the first violinist and a founding member of the Guarneri Quartet.

Many of these were collected in the 1978 volume <em>Where I Live</em>, which is now expanded by noted Williams scholar John S. Bak to include all of Williams&#x2019; theater essays, biographical pieces, introductions and reviews. This volume also includes a few occasional pieces, program notes, and a discreet selection of juvenilia such as his 1927 essay published in <em>Smart Set</em>, which answers the question &#x201c;Can a good wife be a good sport?&#x201d; Wonderful and candid stories abound in these essays&#x2015;from erudite observations on the theater to veneration for great actresses.

In <i>A Climate of Crisis</i>, historian Patrick Allitt shows that our present climate of crisis is far from exceptional. Indeed, the environmental debates of the last half century are defined by exaggeration and fearmongering from all sides, often at the expense of the facts.<br><br>In a real sense, Allitt shows us, collective anxiety about widespread environmental danger began with the atomic bomb. As postwar suburbanization transformed the American landscape, more research and better tools for measurement began to reveal the consequences of economic success. A climate of anxiety became a climate of alarm, often at odds with reality. The sixties generation transformed environmentalism from a set of special interests into a mass movement. By the first Earth Day in 1970, journalists and politicians alike were urging major initiatives to remedy environmental harm. In fact, the work of the new Environmental Protection Agency and a series of clean air and water acts from a responsive Congress inaugurated a largely successful cleanup.<br><br>Political polarization around environmental questions after 1980 had consequences that we still feel today. Since then, the general polarization of American politics has mirrored that of environmental politics, as pro-environmentalists and their critics attribute to one another the worst possible motives. Environmentalists see their critics as greedy special interest groups that show no conscience as they plunder the earth while skeptics see their adversaries as enemies of economic growth whose plans stifle initiative under an avalanche of bureaucratic regulation.<br><br>There may be a germ of truth in both views, but more than a germ of falsehood too. America&#x2019;s worst environmental problems have proven to be manageable; the regulations and cleanups of the last sixty years have often worked, and science and technology have continued to improve industrial efficiency. Our present situation is serious, argues Allitt, but it is far from hopeless. Sweeping and provocative, <i>A Climate of Crisis</i> challenges our basic assumptions about the environment, no matter where we fall along the spectrum&#x2014;reminding us that the answers to our most pressing questions are sometimes found in understanding the past.</p><p><b>Patrick Allitt </b>is the Cahoon Family Professor of American History at Emory University, where he has taught since 1988.

The tone is definitely optimistic about the long view of meeting environmental challenges in the United States. At the same time, in linking past to present, Allitt offers caution about what might unfold in the days to come. Above all else, he touts the value of history in assessing America&#x2019;s complex environmental legacy.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Adam Rome, author of <i>The Genius of Earth Day</i>:</b><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t agree with everything in <i>A Climate of Crisis</i>, but Patrick Allitt&#x2019;s well-written and provocative book has given me more to think about than any other history of the U.S. environmental movement. <i>A Climate of Crisis</i> is both bracing and exciting.&#x201d;</p><h2>Introductory Musical Acoustics</h2><p>Introductory Musical Acoustics: Fourth Edition.

Published alongside his short story collection, Sonja&#39;s Blue, these books are interesting evidence in the controversy over the influence of former Knopf editor Gordon Lish (who edited The Red Truck but not the short stories.) Lish edited Wilson as he edited Raymond Carver, with dazzling results that may be compared to the author&#39;s original and unedited writing in Sonja&#39;s Blue.</p><p>Rudy Wilson received an MFA degree at the University of Iowa and has taught in the Iowa Writer s Program. He is the recipient of an NEA grant and the Michener Award as well as the GE-CCLM award for short fiction in The Paris Review from the Coordinating Council for Literary Magazines. He is the author of a companion volume from Ravenna Press, the collection Sonja&#39;s Blue and the novel A Girl Named Jesus.Wilson's daring but overly ambitious first novel is written in the voices of Billy-Billy Jump and Teddianne Sayers, two mentally scarred protagonists who, through reincarnation, have connected with each other in several violence-fraught lifetimes. They share a keen love of Christ; Teddianne envisions Christ, who also "goes on forever," as a red truck. Staccato sentences often evoke powerful images and emotions, such as Billy-Billy's description of his near-death by suffocation inside a locked refrigerator at age seven, an incident that claimed his brother's life. But many teasing paragraphs withhold their secrets from the reader who can only wonder what to make of the convoluted concepts: "Then the yellow started coming . . . . There were hundreds of yellows. . . . I put back my head and opened my mouth to let some out. Then I saw how yellows weren't yellow at all, but were made out of no-color, then only later they changed to become their colorness, yellow." Even those who share the author's powerful belief in the transmigration of souls may need a road map to follow Billy-Billy and Teddianne through their various mutations. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Children on Their Birthdays</h2><p>&#39;...We were sitting on the porch, tutti-frutti melting on our plates, when suddenly, just as we were wishing that something would happen, something did; for out of the red road dust appeared Miss Bobbit.&#39; Truman Capote&#39;s bewitching short stories, many of which were set in the Deep South of his youth, are among his finest works.

He ran away from home, which was a ridiculous, somewhat lowering way of putting it when he owned the house and was almost twenty-four years old. But the simple fact was that he bolted.<br><br>He took with him his valet, Martin Fisk; his traveling carriage and horses; and enough clothes and other necessary belongings to last him a month or two&#x2014;or six. He really did not know how long he would stay away. He took his violin too after a moment&#x2019;s hesitation. His friends liked to tease him about it and affect horror every time he tucked it beneath his chin, but he thought he played it tolerably well. More important, he liked playing it. It soothed his soul, though he never confided that thought to his friends. Flavian would no doubt make a comment along the lines of its scratching the boot soles of everyone else who happened to be within earshot.<br><br>The main trouble with home was that he was afflicted with too many female relatives and not enough male ones&#x2014;and no assertive males. His grandmother and his mother lived with him, and his three sisters, though married with homes and families of their own, came to stay all too frequently, and often for lengthy spells. Hardly a month went by without at least one of them being in residence for a few days or a week or more. His brothers-in-law, when they came with their wives&#x2014;which was not every time&#x2014;tactfully held themselves aloof from Vincent&#x2019;s affairs and allowed their womenfolk to rule his life, even though it was worthy of note that none of them allowed their wives to rule theirs.<br><br>It all would have been understandable, even under ordinary circumstances, Vincent supposed grudgingly. He was, after all, everyone&#x2019;s only grandson or only son or only brother&#x2014;and younger brother at that&#x2014;and as such was fair game to be protected and cosseted and worried over and planned for. He had inherited his title and fortune just four years ago, at the age of nineteen, from an uncle who had been robust and only forty-six years old when he died and who had had a son as sturdy and fit as he. They had both died violently. Life was a fragile business and so was the inheritance, Vincent&#x2019;s female relatives were fond of observing. It behooved him, therefore, to fill his nursery with an heir and a number of spares as soon as was humanly possible. It was irrelevant that he was still very young and would not even have begun to think of matrimony yet, left to himself. His family knew all they cared to know about living in genteel poverty.<br><br>His were not ordinary circumstances, however, and as a result, his relatives clucked about him like a flock of mother hens all intent upon nurturing the same frail chick while somehow avoiding smothering it. His mother had moved to Middlebury Park in Gloucestershire even before he did. She had got it ready for him. His maternal grandmother had let the lease expire on her house in Bath and joined his mother there. And after he moved in, three years ago, his sisters began to find Middlebury the most fascinating place on earth to be. And Vincent need not worry about their husbands feeling neglected, they had collectively assured him. Their husbands understood. The word was always spoken with something like hushed reverence.<br><br>In fact, most of what they all said to him was spoken in much the same manner, as though he were some sort of precious but mentally deficient child.<br><br>This year they had begun to talk pointedly about marriage. His marriage, that was. Even apart from the succession issue, marriage would bring him comfort and companionship, they had decided, and all kinds of other assorted benefits. Marriage would enable them to relax and worry less about him. It would enable his grandmother to return to Bath, which she was missing. And it would not be at all difficult to find a lady willing and even eager to marry him. He must not imagine it would be. He was titled and wealthy, after all. And he had youth and looks and charm. There were hordes of ladies out there who would understand and actually be quite happy to marry him. They would quickly learn to love him for himself. At least, one would, the one he would choose. And they, his female relatives, would help him make that choice, of course. That went without saying, though they said it anyway.<br><br>The campaign had started over Easter, when the whole family was at Middlebury, his sisters&#x2019; husbands and their children included. Vincent himself had just returned from Penderris Hall in Cornwall, country seat of the Duke of Stanbrook, where he spent a few weeks of each year with his fellow members of the self-styled Survivors&#x2019; Club, a group of survivors of the Napoleonic Wars, and he had been feeling a little bereft, as he always did for a while after parting from those dearest friends in the world. He had let the women talk without paying a great deal of attention or even thinking of perhaps putting his foot down.<br><br>It had proved to be a mistake.<br><br>Only a month after Easter his sisters and brothers-in-law and nieces and nephews had returned en masse, to be followed a day or so later by houseguests. It was still only spring and an odd time of year for a house party, when the social Season in London would be just getting into full swing. But this was not really a party, Vincent had soon discovered, for the only guests who were not also family were Mr. Geoffrey Dean, son of Grand�mama&#x2019;s dearest friend in Bath, his wife, and their three daughters. Their two sons were away at school. Two of the daughters were still in the schoolroom&#x2014;their governess had been brought with them. But the eldest, Miss Philippa Dean, was almost nineteen and had made her curtsy to the queen just a couple of weeks before and secured partners for every set at her come-out ball. She had made a very satisfactory debut indeed into polite society.<br><br>But, Mrs. Dean was hasty to add while describing her daughter&#x2019;s triumph over tea soon after their arrival at Middlebury Park, how could they possibly have resisted the prospect of spending a quiet couple of weeks in the country with old friends?<br><br>Old friends?<br><br>The situation had soon become painfully clear to Vincent, though no one bothered to explain. Miss Phi�lippa Dean was on the marriage mart to the highest bidder. She had younger sisters growing up behind her and two brothers at school who might conceivably wish to continue their studies at university. It seemed unlikely that the Deans were vastly wealthy. They had come, then, on the clear understanding that there was a husband to be had for the girl at Middlebury and that she would return to London with all the distinction of being betrothed within a month of her come-out. It would be a singular triumph, especially as she would be securing a husband who was both wealthy and titled.<br><br>And who also happened to be blind.<br><br>Miss Dean was exquisitely lovely, his mother reported, with blond hair and green eyes and a trim figure. Not that her looks mattered to him. She sounded like a sweet and amiable girl.<br><br>She also sounded quite sensible when in conversation with everyone except Vincent himself. She often was in conversation with him during the following few days, however. Every other female in the house, with the possible exception of Vincent&#x2019;s three young nieces, did everything in her power to throw the two of them together and to leave them together. Even a blind man could see that.<br><br>She conversed with him upon trivialities in a gentle, somewhat breathless voice, as though she were in a sickroom and the patient hung precariously between death and life. Whenever Vincent tried to steer the conversation to some meaningful topic in order to discover something of her interests and opinions and the quality of her mind, she invariably agreed wholeheartedly with everything he said, even to the point of absurdity.<br><br>&#x201c;I am firmly of the opinion,&#x201d; he said to her one afternoon when they were sitting together in the formal parterre gardens before the house despite a rather strong breeze, &#x201c;that the scientific world has been in a wicked conspiracy against the masses for the past number of centuries, Miss Dean, in order to convince us that the earth is round. It is, of course, quite undeniably flat. Even a fool could see that. If one were to walk to the edge of it, one would fall off and never be heard of again. What is your opinion?&#x201d;<br><br>It was unkind. It was a bit mean.<br><br>She was silent for several moments, while he willed her to contradict him. Or laugh at him. Or call him an idiot. Her voice was gentler than ever when she spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;I am quite sure you have the right of it, my lord,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>He almost said &#x201c;Balderdash!&#x201d; but did not. He would not add cruelty to unkindness. He merely smiled and felt ashamed of himself and talked about the blustery wind.<br><br>And then he felt the fingers of one of her hands on his sleeve, and he could smell her light floral perfume more clearly, an indication that she had leaned closer, and she spoke again&#x2014;in a sweet, hurried, breathless voice.<br><br>&#x201c;I did not at all mind coming here, you know, Lord Darleigh,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;even though I have been looking forward forever to my first Season in London and do not remember ever being happier than I was on the night of my come-out ball. But I know enough about life to understand that I was taken there not just for enjoyment. Mama and Papa have explained what a wonderful opportunity this invitation is for me, as well as for my sisters and brothers. I did not mind coming, truly. Indeed, I came willingly. I understand, you see, and I will not mind one little bit.&#x201d;<br><br>Her fingers squeezed his arm before letting it go.<br><br>&#x201c;You will think I am forward,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;though I am not usually so outspoken. I just thought you needed to know that I do not mind. For perhaps you fear I do.&#x201d;<br><br>It was one of the most excruciatingly embarrassing moments of Vincent&#x2019;s life, as well as being almost insufferably infuriating. Not that she infuriated him, poor girl. But her parents did, and his mother and grandmother and sisters did. It was quite obvious to him that Miss Dean had been brought here not just as an eligible young lady whom he might get to know with the possibility on both their parts of deepening their acquaintance in the future if they liked each other. No, she had been brought here fully expecting that he would make her an offer before she left. Pressure would have been brought to bear by her parents, but she was a dutiful daughter, it seemed, and accepted her responsibility as the eldest. She would marry him even though he was blind.<br><br>She very obviously did mind.<br><br>He was angry with his mother and sisters for assuming that mental deficiency was one effect of blindness. He had known they wished him to marry soon. He had known that they would proceed to matchmake for him. What he had not known was that they would choose his bride without a word to him and then practically force him into accepting their choice&#x2014;and in his own home, moreover.<br><br>His house, in fact, was not his own home&#x2014;that realization came like an epiphany. It never had been. Whose fault that was must be examined at some future date. It was tempting to blame his relatives, but . . . Well, he would have to think the whole matter over.<br><br>He had a niggling suspicion, though, that if he was not master here, the fault lay with him.<br><br>But for now he was in an impossible situation. He felt no spark of attraction toward Miss Dean, even though he believed he would very probably like her under different circumstances. It was clear she felt nothing for him but the obligation to marry him. He could not, though, allow both of them to be coerced into doing what neither of them wanted to do.<br><br>As soon as they had returned indoors&#x2014;Miss Dean took his offered arm and then proceeded to steer him along with gentle but firm intent even though he had his cane with him and knew the way perfectly well without any assistance at all&#x2014;Vincent went to his private sitting room&#x2014;the only place in the house where he could be assured of being alone and of being himself&#x2014;and summoned Martin Fisk.<br><br>&#x201c;We are going,&#x201d; he said abruptly when his valet arrived.<br><br>&#x201c;Are we, sir?&#x201d; Martin asked cheerfully. &#x201c;And what clothes will you be needing for the occasion?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will need everything that will fit into the trunk I always take to Penderris,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;You will doubtless decide for yourself what you need.&#x201d;<br><br>A low grunt was followed by silence.<br><br>&#x201c;I am feeling especially stupid today,&#x201d; Martin said. &#x201c;You had better explain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We are going,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;Leaving. Putting as much distance between us and Middlebury as we possibly can in order to evade pursuit. Slinking off. Running away. Taking the coward&#x2019;s way out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The lady does not suit, does she?&#x201d; Martin asked.<br><br>Ha! Even Martin knew why the girl had been brought here.<br><br>&#x201c;Not as a wife,&#x201d; Vincent told him. &#x201c;Not as my wife, anyway. Good Lord, Martin, I do not even want to marry. Not yet. And if and when I do want it, I shall choose the lady myself. Very carefully. And I shall make sure that if she says yes, it is not simply because she understands and will not mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; Martin said. &#x201c;That is what this one said, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With the softest, gentlest sweetness,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;She is sweet and gentle, actually. She is prepared to make a martyr of herself for the sake of her family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we are running away where?&#x201d; Martin asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Anywhere on earth but here,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;Can we leave tonight? Without anyone&#x2019;s knowing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I grew up at a smithy,&#x201d; Martin reminded him. &#x201c;I think I could manage to attach the horses to the carriage without getting the lines hopelessly tangled up. But presumably I won&#x2019;t have to risk it. I suppose you will want Handry to drive us? I&#x2019;ll have a word with him. He knows how to keep his lips sealed. Two o&#x2019;clock in the morning, shall we say? I&#x2019;ll come and carry your trunk out and then come back to dress you. We should be well on our way by three.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; Vincent said.<br><br>They were about one mile on their way when Martin, occupying the seat opposite Vincent&#x2019;s in the carriage, his back to the horses, reported that it was three o&#x2019;clock.<br><br>Vincent refused to feel guilty&#x2014;and of course was consumed by nothing but guilt. And by the conviction that he was the world&#x2019;s worst cad and coward, not to mention worst son and brother and grandson. And gentleman. But really, what else could he have done, short of marrying Miss Philippa Dean or publicly humiliating her?<br><br>But would she not be equally humiliated to learn that he had fled?<br><br>Arrghh!<br><br>He chose to believe that behind any momentary humiliation she might feel would be an enormous relief. He was sure she would be relieved, poor girl.<br><br>They went to the Lake District and spent three blissful weeks there. It was reputed to be one of the loveliest parts of England, though much of its beauty was lost on a blind man, of course. Not all of it, however. There were country lanes to stroll along, many of them parallel to the banks of Lake Windermere or some other, lesser lakes. There were hills to climb, some of them requiring strenuous effort&#x2014;and stronger winds and more rarefied air as a reward when they climbed high. There was rain and sunshine and chill and warmth, all the wonderful variety of English weather and countryside. There was a boat ride, on which he could pull the oars himself, and horse rides&#x2014;with Martin at his side but never touching him. There was even one glorious gallop across flat land, which, in Martin&#x2019;s careful estimation, did ...</p><h2>Origins of Nature&#39;s Beauty: Essays by Alexander F. Skutch (Corrie Herring Hooks Series)</h2><p>A lifetime's keen observation of the physical world has led Alexander Skutch to ask deeply philosophical questions about the nature of "nature." In this thought-provoking study, he turns his attention to the problem of how "quality"--beauty, goodness, morality--has arisen in a process of evolution that appears to favor sheer "quantity."<br>Skutch draws his examples from the natural wonders he knows best--birds, butterflies, and flowers. He shows how each uses beauty to attract mates or pollinators and repel or hide from predators--all instances where quality serves the goal of increasing the quantity of a species. More than this, Skutch offers intriguing evidence that animals may possess an aesthetic sense and consciously choose beautiful objects, just as humans do.<br>These views, running counter to prevailing mechanistic explanations of natural processes, offer food for thought to both specialists and the general public. It is Skutch's deeply held conviction that naturalists should try to discover and make widely known whatever is "fair and heartening" in nature, in contrast to the apparent randomness and violence of Darwinian natural selection.</p><p></p><h2>First Wave</h2><p>First Wave introduces a new generation to pulp characters of yesteryear through the eyes of Eisner Award winning author Brian Azzarello.

Although progress has been made in the last decade towards both understanding and ameliorating Indigenous health inequalities, very little research or writing has expanded a social determinants of health framework to account for the unique histories and present realities of Indigenous peoples in this country. This timely edited collection addresses this significant knowledge gap, exploring the ways that multiple health determinants beyond the social-from colonialism to geography, from economy to biology-converge to impact the health status of Indigenous peoples in Canada.<br><br>This unique collection, comprised largely of contributions by Indigenous authors, offers the voices and expertise of First Nations, Inuit, and Metis writers from across Canada. The multitude of health determinants of Indigenous peoples are considered in a selection of chapters that range from scholarly papers by research experts in the field, to reflective essays by Indigenous leaders. Appropriate throughout a range of disciplines, including Health Studies, Indigenous Studies, Public and Population Health, Community Health Sciences, Medicine, Nursing, and Social Work, this engaging text broadens the social determinants of health framework to better understand health inequality. Most importantly, it does so by placing front and center the voices and experiences of Indigenous peoples.</p><p>Margo Greenwood is a Professor of Education and First Nations Studies at the University of Northern British Columbia, an Academic Leader at the National Collaborating Centre for Aboriginal Health, and the Vice President of Aboriginal Health with the Northern Health Authority.

Refuting widely accepted opinions that after Culloden pipes and pipers were effectively banned in Scotland by the Disarming Act (1746), Gibson reveals that traditional dance bagpiping continued at least to the mid-nineteenth century. He argues that the dramatic depopulation of the Highlands in the nineteenth century was one of the main reasons for the decline of piping. Following the path of Scottish emigrants, Gibson traces the history of bagpiping in the New World and uncovers examples of late eighteenth-century traditional bagpiping and dance in Gaelic Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. He argues that these anachronistic cultural forms provide a vital link to the vanished folk music and culture of the Scottish highlanders. This definitive study throws light on the ways pipers and piping contributed to social integration in the days of the clan system and on the decline in Scottish Gaelic culture following the abolition of clans. It also illuminates the cultural problems faced by all ethnic minorities assimilated into unitary multinational societies.</p><p>CA&#34;A must-read for all piping aficionados and those with a taste for the sacred cow.&#34; The Voice &#34;This is a book that every piping enthusiast should read.&#34; Celtic Heritage &#34;Traditional Gaelic Bagpiping&#39;s contribution to the region&#39;s cultural history is priceless.&#34; Atlantic Books Today &#34;By studying and reinterpreting the historical relationship between traditional Scottish and New World preliterate piping Traditional Gaelic Bagpiping, 1745-1945 vastly enriches our knowledge of both of them.

Taking a brief hiatus from her mystery series featuring LAPD Homicide Detective Peter Decker and his Orthodox Jewish wife, Rina Lazarus, Kellerman delivers a masterful stand-alone crime novel that crackles with suspense and tantalizes with a touch of the paranormal. The horribly savaged body of a once-beautiful Vegas showgirl is discovered in the desert not far from the world-famous Strip, plunging Detective Sergeant Romulus Poe into the heart of a bizarre, full moon-soaked mystery that could cost him everything he holds dear in life, including his sanity.<br></p></p><p>In <i>Moon Music</i> Faye Kellerman turns her attention from the streets of Los Angeles, where her previous novels were set, to the casinos of Las Vegas. A mutilated body of a young woman is discovered in the desert and Detective Sergeant Romulus Poe sets out to determine who could have committed the murder and the brutal desecration that followed. His team of investigators include the tall and lusty Steve Jensen, novice Patricia Deluca, and medical examiner Rukmani Kalil. The relations between the four are complex and add depth to this tale of deadly dealings: Poe carries a torch for Jensen's mentally troubled wife and knows of his colleague's philandering; Kalil and Poe are engaged in an off-again, on-again affair. Although collectively they feel as though they are making progress in the case, another similarly mutilated corpse is found within a matter of weeks, turning the mystery from that of a peculiarly brutal murder in the singular to the search for a serial killer.<p> It's a tight, tense read. Kellerman engages the reader with her carefully wrought characters and with her sense of place. Las Vegas not only sets the stage for the story but is central to it. The seeds of the crime were planted in its small town past as a nuclear test sight and only reach their fruition in the gambling and selling of sex and drugs in the present. Kellerman ties it all together beautifully, with extraordinary hints of Native American mysticism and government conspiracies. In another's hands, such flights of fancy would verge on the ridiculous, but Kellerman manages to keep her fantastic plots well under control. For those with a strong stomach and an imaginative streak, <i>Moon Music</i> is a captivating thriller. <i>--K.A.

But there is something about this unfortunate young woman's death&#x2014;and a similar murder that is to follow soon after&#x2014;that harkens back to an unsolved slaying and so-called suicide a quarter century ago. The grim similarities&#x2014;along with some frightening new possibilities&#x2014;are leading Poe into a night world of dark shadows best left unilluminated and pulling the inquisitive policeman toward secrets from a strange and sordid past that could destroy those closest to him, and drag him over the edge.</p><p></p></p><h2>Private Tuscany</h2><p>Tuscany has long exerted a magnetic pull over visitors to this most romantic of Italy's provinces. From Lord Byron and Henry James to contemporary writers, designers, and artists, everyone is charmed by the rolling Tuscan landscape, its magical light, its rich artistic and visual culture, and above all, its highly sensuous way of life.<br><br><i>Private Tuscany</i> reveals the interior style of some of the area's most charming homes--the pared-down beauty of a film director's farmhouse retreat; the refined elegance of an aristocrat's seventeenth-centry palazzo high in the hills; the Gothic mood of a winemaker's medieval fortress; the modern chic of a designer's country house; or the earthy character of an architect's villa, drenched with color and light.<br><br>Whether it is the ancient terra-cotta floors, gardens fragrant with herbs, or candlelit dinners on outdoor terraces, the spirit of living in Tuscany is alive in these pages in brilliant color.<br></p><p>Tuscany's hill towns and countryside have enthralled inhabitants and visitors for centuries--the golden light in the afternoons, the grape arbors, and the rolling hillsides dotted with rustic farmhouses and villas. <i>Private Tuscany</i> invites us into these dwellings, giving us a glimpse of how life is lived in this warm, inviting place. <p> The homes featured in this gorgeous volume are as enchanting as the Tuscan towns and hillsides they're built on. Many embody a style we've come to associate with Tuscany: dark-timbered kitchens with dried herbs and garlic ropes hung from the rafters, original terra-cotta tile floors, large-windowed living rooms, and artfully frescoed walls. There are centuries-old furnishings crafted by skilled Italian artisans and elegantly manicured gardens containing hidden grottos and classical statuary. But the homes also reflect the special touches of the people who occupy them. For instance, a theater lover displays his exquisite collection of miniature theaters in the salon; the daughter of a villa owner paints traditional murals on the walls and mosaic patterns on the floors.</p><p> Simon McBride's photographs skillfully capture the magic of these Tuscan homes and feature a variety of residences, from simple farmhouses to grand villas and palaces. The book's four chapters divide the homes into types: rustic, classic, grand, and modern. An index at the back serves as an introduction to Tuscany's pleasures, providing contact information for sampling the region's wine and produce, fine dining, hotels and houses, gardens, and crafts.</p><p> Several of the homeowners featured in <i>Private Tuscany</i> have gone to painstaking lengths to restore these buildings after decades, or even centuries, of neglect.

Schlesinger Jr. strikes a blow against radical multiculturalism. The rising cult of ethnicity, he argues, threatens a common American identity, imperiling the civic ideals that traditionally have bonded immigrants into a nation. Various chapters criticize bilingual education, Afrocentrism, and the use of history as group therapy for minorities. Schlesinger raised eyebrows when he first published this book in 1992 because of his impeccable liberal credentials as a one-time assistant to President Kennedy and long-standing academic champion of FDR's New Deal. This new version contains all of the original volume's edge, plus a few extras, including an appendix containing "Schlesinger's Syllabus," 13 books "indispensable to an understanding of America."

Jeter&#x2019;s wit and imagination shine through ten vignettes that capture a variety of mischievous childhood capers. Numerous detailed sketches, which accompany every vignette, enable readers to visualize all of the fascinating locations and intriguing inventions of Bill&#x2019;s childhood in the quiet California mountain town of Hornbrook in the &#x2019;40s. Men and women alike will get lost in their own remembering of childhood adventures as they laugh and cry with Bill, and children will not only be inspired to creative play, but will long to hear their parents&#x2019; and grandparents&#x2019; stories of the past.</p><p>What does it take to discover a hidden passion like writing? For Bill Jeter, all it took was a counselor&#x2019;s probing inquiry about a scene in his childhood. She asked him to work through grief by writing about a painful childhood experience&#x2014;his little sister&#x2019;s death after falling off of her bicycle. The counselor had no idea that opening the wound would facilitate Bill&#x2019;s discovery of a world of joyful memories underneath the sadness. As soon as his very sharp #2 pencil hit the paper, exciting recollections of his Huck Finn childhood seemed to call out from the depths for expression. <p>Bill went from writing about his little sister to composing hilarious mosaics drawn from childhood adventures that he and his friends engaged in to amuse themselves during those innocent years when he thought kids weren&#x2019;t supposed to die. </p><p>Surprised by the powerful, life-giving force of writing about people and places that impacted his growing up years, Bill enthusiastically shared his stories with these long-time friends. Their positive feedback encouraged him to share his artfully crafted stories with a wider audience, which led to greater demand for his book. </p><p>Bill&#x2019;s passion for adventure and for the great out-of-doors, as evidenced in the ten vignettes in BOYHOOD ALONG THE BROOK CALLED HORN, did not stop in childhood. Over the years he pursued backpacking, canoeing, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, skydiving, flying lessons, and art lessons. Ever eager to answer the call to a challenge, at the age of 50, Bill started serious mountain climbing. All of this was in addition to his years as a successful businessman (including 27 years as a self-employed State Farm agent), a Sunday School teacher, and a Boy Scout leader. A dedicated family man, now a widower after 34 years of marriage, Bill enjoys the freedom of retirement which allows him to spend more time with his son, daughter, grandson, and his sister... and his new passion, writing.</p></p><h2>Scared Selfless: My Journey from Abuse and Madness to Surviving and Thriving</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A riveting memoir that takes readers on a roller coaster ride from the depths of hell to triumphant success.&#x201d;&#x2014;Dave Pelzer, author of <i>A Child Called <b>&#x201c;</b>It<b>&#x201d;</b></i></b><br><br>Michelle Stevens has a photo of the exact moment her childhood was stolen from her: She&#x2019;s only eight years old, posing for her mother&#x2019;s boyfriend, Gary Lundquist&#x2014;an elementary school teacher, neighborhood stalwart, and brutal pedophile.

Aboriginal rock art, as practised in Arnhem Land, is the world&#39;s longest continuing art tradition. It is a tradition that is not merely decorative, but provides a &#34;journey in time&#34; - a pictoral record of the longest surviving culture on earth. Occurring at thousands of different sites, and of many different styles, the rock paintings of this region date from at least 30,000 years ago, and some may have been in place as early as 50,000 years ago. The oldest galleries pre-date the Hall of Bulls and Lascaux in France. This book explores the depth and complexity of this art tradition and gives insight into the aesthetic and cultural worlds of the people who created it. The book has been written and illustrated with the permission of the Gagudju people, the traditional owners of the land.</p><p></p><h2>Lost Souls</h2><p>True crime writer Kristi Benz, searching for the one case that will take her to the top, gets her wish when she enrolls at All Saints College to investigate the brutal murders of three troubled girls, all of whom were found with the blood drained from their bodies, and comes face-to-face with a sadistic killer.</p><p>Lisa Jackson has been writing romantic fiction for fifteen years. Over sixty of her books have been published and reprinted in more than a dozen foreign languages. A single mother, she is a native of Oregon, where she still resides with her two teenage sons.

As Oscar Wilde is purported to have said, &#34;Life is too important to be taken seriously.&#34;When four young women disappear from All Saints College, neither the college nor the New Orleans Police take much notice. But Kristi Bentz is interested, so she enrolls at the school to investigate the disappearances with the intent of writing a book about them. She encounters a cult of vampirism, horror, and murder, and by the time she gets the attention of the police, she herself has become a victim. Joyce Bean does the best job possible with the melodramatic and repetitive writing (especially the sex scenes). Her character voices are believable and well differentiated, and she handles the over-the-top aspects of the story adroitly. Nonetheless, this book would be more appealing in an abridged version. S.S.R. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>The Diagnosis: A Novel</h2><p>Alan Lightman's first novel, <b>Einstein's Dreams</b>, was greeted with international praise. Salman Rushdie called it "at once intellectually provocative and touching and comic and so very beautifully written." Michiko Kakutani wrote in <i>The New York Times</i> that the novel creates "a magical, metaphysical realm . . . as in Calvino's work, the fantastical elements of the stories are grounded in precise, crystalline prose." With <b>The Diagnosis</b>, Lightman gives us his most ambitious and penetrating novel yet.<br><br>While rushing to his office one warm summer morning, Bill Chalmers, a junior executive, realizes that he cannot remember where he is going or even who he is. All he remembers is the motto of his company: The maximum information in the minimum time.<br><br>When Bill's memory returns, "his head pounding, remembering too much," a strange numbness afflicts him, beginning as a tingling in his hands and gradually spreading over the rest of his body. As he attempts to find a diagnosis of his illness, he descends into a nightmare, enduring a blizzard of medical tests and specialists without conclusive results, the manic frenzy of his company, and a desperate wife who decides that he must be imagining his deteriorating condition.<br><br>By turns satiric, comic, and tragic, <b>The Diagnosis</b> is a brilliant and disturbing examination of our modern obsession with speed, information, and money, and what this obsession has done to our minds and our spirits.</p><p>In the bravura opening chapter of Alan Lightman's novel <i>The Diagnosis</i>, a nameless horror befalls Boston businessman Bill Chalmers in the hubbub of his morning commute. As he jostles his way aboard the train and makes cell-phone calls to check last-minute details on his morning meeting (for Bill is punctilious), a realization surfaces in his brain, "like a trapped bubble of air rising from the bottom of a deep pond." He has forgotten where he's going. All he can remember is his anxious urgency and his company's creed, "The maximum information in the minimum time." Acutely aware that he's got a 9:15 appointment, but recalling only the first six digits of his phone number, Bill helplessly gazes out the window. "Trees flew by like flailing arms.... Railroad tracks fluttered by like matchsticks. Trees, white and gray clapboard houses with paint peeling off, junkyards with stacks of flaccid tires." Lightman's Kafka pastiche is as pitch perfect as his verbal music: note the rhyming <i>x</i> sounds in <i>stacks</i> and <i>flaccid</i> (which is not pronounced "flassid"). <p> Terrifyingly soon, Bill is mad, homeless, beaten, and experimented on by comically evil doctors. He recovers and reunites with his family, but inexorably, mysterious paralysis ensues. Doctors try to diagnose him. Coworkers offer empty condolences and plot to steal his fast-track job. His wife seeks consolation with a passionate virtual lover on the Internet, a professor she's never met in the flesh. His teenage son triumphantly hacks into AOL's Plato Online, and Bill's last days are counterpointed with the trial of Socrates and his troubled, rich inquisitor Anytus. Instead of the real story, we get a second shimmering Lightman fable. Anytus's strife with his rebel son, a Socrates supporter, parallels Bill's grief as his son is distanced from him by illness. </p><p> Though I felt glimmerings of understanding from time to time, I never did fully figure out exactly what the Socrates story and Bill's decline have to say about each other, nor what Bill's paralysis says about modern times. I implore a smarter reader to explain it to me in the customer comments below. But I can tell you that every character is resonant, and every sensory particular is exquisitely precise, as in Lightman's biggest hit, the Italo Calvino pastiche <i>Einstein's Dreams</i>. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"The Diagnosis is packed with dark power and awful humor. Lightman's intelligence, imagination, and clarity of style mark him as one of the most brilliant contemporary American writers."<br>-- Annie Proulx<br><br>"I know of no novel that captures the technological horror and pervasive spiritual poverty of our wildly prosperous land in so powerful a way as The Diagnosis.

A native of South Carolina, Savage holds a PhD in philosophy from Yale University, was once an editor of a literary quarterly, and now lives in Madison, Wisconsin. Michael Mikolowski, illustrator of Firmin and editor of the now defunct arts and comic 'zine Meat City, is an artist who lives just outside of Detroit.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>I had always imagined that my life story, if and when I wrote it, would have a great first line: something lyric like Nabokov's "Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins"; or if I could not do lyric, then something sweeping like Tolstoy's "All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." People remember those words even when they have forgotten everything else about the books. When it comes to openers, though, the best in my view has to be the beginning of Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier: "This is the saddest story I have ever heard." I've read that one dozens of times and it still knocks my socks off. Ford Madox Ford was a Big One. <br><br>In all my life struggling to write I have struggled with nothing so manfully&#x2014;yes, that's the word, manfully&#x2014;as with openers. It has always seemed to me that if I could just get that bit right all the rest would follow automatically. I thought of that first sentence as a kind of semantic womb stuffed with the busy embryos of unwritten pages, brilliant little nuggets of genius practically panting to be born. From that grand vessel the entire story would, so to speak, ooze forth. What a delusion! Exactly the opposite was true. And it is not as if there weren't any good ones. Savor this, for example: "When the phone rang at 3:00 a.m. Morris Monk knew even before picking up the receiver that the call was from a dame, and he knew something else too: dames meant trouble." Or this: "Just before being hacked to pieces by Gamel's sadistic soldiers, Colonel Benchley had a vision of the little whitewashed cottage in Shropshire, and Mrs. Benchley in the doorway, and the children." Or this: "Paris, London, Djibouti, all seemed unreal to him now as he sat amid the ruins of yet another Thanksgiving dinner with his mother and father and that idiot Charles." Who can remain unimpressed by sentences like these? They are so pregnant with meaning, so, I dare say, poignant with it that they positively bulge with whole unwritten chapters&#x2014;unwritten, but there, already there! <br>Alas, in reality they were nothing but bubbles, illusions every one. Each of the wonderful phrases, so full of promise, was like a gift-wrapped box clutched in a small child's eager hand, a box that holds nothing but gravel and bits of trash, though it rattles oh so enticingly. He thinks it is candy! I thought it was literature. All those sentences&#x2014;and many, many others as wel&#x2014;proved to be not springboards to the great unwritten novel but insurmountable barriers to it. You see, they were too good. I could never live up to them. Some writers can never equal their first novel. I could never equal my first sentence. And look at me now. Look how I have begun this, my final work, my opus: "I had always imagined that my life story, if and when . . ." Good God, "if and when"! You see the problem. Hopeless. Scratch it.<br>This is the saddest story I have ever heard. It begins, like all true stories, who knows where. Looking for the beginning is like trying to discover the source of a river. You paddle upstream for months under a burning sun, between towering green walls of dripping jungle, soggy maps disintegrating in your hands. You are driven half mad by false hopes, malicious swarms of biting insects, and the tricks of memory, and all you reach at the end&#x2014;the ultima Thule of the whole ridiculous quest&#x2014;is a damp spot in the jungle or, in the case of a story, some perfectly meaningless word or gesture. And yet, at some more or less arbitrary place along the way between the damp spot and the sea the cartographer inserts the point of his compass, and there the Amazon begins. <br><br>It is the same with me, cartographer of the soul, when I look for the beginning of my life story. I close my eyes and stab. I open them and discover a fluttering instant impaled on my compass point: 3:17 p.m. on the thirtieth of April, 1961. I scrunch up my eyes and bring it into focus. Moment, moment on a pin, where's the fellow with no chin? And there I am&#x2014;or, rather, there I was&#x2014;peering cautiously out over the edge of a balcony, just the tip of my nose and one eye. That balcony was a good spot for a looker, a sly peerer like me. From it I could survey the whole shop floor and yet not be seen by any of the people below. That day the store was crowded, more customers than usual for a weekday, and their murmurs floated pleasantly up. It was a beautiful spring afternoon, and some of these people had probably been out for a stroll, thinking about this and that, when their inattention was diverted by a large hand-painted sign in the store window: 30% off all purchases over $20. But I wouldn't really know about that, I mean about what might have attracted them into the store, since I have had no actual experience with the exchange value of money. And indeed the balcony, the store, the customers, even the spring, require explanations, digressions that, however necessary, would wreck the pace of my narrative, which I like to think of as headlong. I have obviously gone too far&#x2014;in my enthusiasm to get the whole thing going I have overshot the mark. We may never know where a story begins, but we sometimes can tell where it cannot begin, where the stream is already in full flood.<br><br>I close my eyes and stab again. I unfold the fluttering instant and pin its wings to the desk: 1:42 a.m., November 9, 1960. It was cold and damp in Boston's Scollay Square, and poor ignorant Flo&#x2014;whom I would know shortly as Mama&#x2014;had taken refuge in the basement of a shop on Cornhill. In her great fright she had somehow contrived to squeeze herself into the far end of a very narrow slot between a large metal cylinder and the concrete wall of the cellar, and she crouched there shaking with fear and cold. She could hear from up on the street level the shouts and laughter drifting away across the Square. They had almost had her that time&#x2014;five men in sailor suits, stamping and kicking and shouting like crazy people. She had been zigzagging this way and that&#x2014;fool them as to your intention, hope they crash into each other&#x2014;when a polished black shoe caught her a blow to the ribs that sent her flying across the sidewalk. <br><br>So how did she escape?<br><br>The way we always escape. By a miracle: the darkness, the rain, a crack in a doorway, a misstep by a pursuer. Pursuit and Escape in America's Oldest Cities. In the scramble of her panic she had managed to get all the way around behind the curved metal thing, so that only a faint glow reached her from the lighted basement, and there she crouched a long time without moving. She closed her eyes against the pain in her side and focused her mind instead on the delicious warmth of the cellar that was rising slowly through her body like a tide. The metal thing was deliciously warm. Its enameled smoothness felt soft, and she pressed her trembling body up against it. Perhaps she slept. Yes, I am sure of it, she slept, and she woke refreshed. <br><br>And then, timid and uncertain, she must have crept from her cave out into the room. A faintly humming fluorescent lamp hanging by a pair of twisted wires from the ceiling cast a flickering bluish light on her surroundings. On her surroundings? What a laugh! On my surroundings! For all around her, everywhere she looked, were books. Floor to ceiling against every wall as well as against both sides of a counter-high partition that ran down the center of the room stood unpainted wooden shelves into which rows of books had been jammed to bursting. Other books, mostly taller volumes, had been wedged in flat on top of these, while still others rose in towering ziggurats from the floor or lay in precarious stacks and sloping piles on top of the partition. This warm musty place where she had found refuge was a mausoleum of books, a museum of forgotten treasures, a cemetery of the unread and unreadable. Old leatherbound tomes, cracked and mildewed, rubbed shoulders with cheap newer books whose yellowing pages had gone brown and brittle at the edges. There were Zane Grey westerns by the saddleload, books of lugubrious sermons by the casketful, old encyclopedias, memoirs of the Great War, diatribes against the New Deal, instruction manuals for the New Woman. But of course Flo did not know that these things were books. Adventures on the Planet Earth. I enjoy picturing her as she peers about at this strange landscape&#x2014;her kind, worn face, her stout body, no, her rotund body, the glittering, hunted eyes, and the cute way she has of wrinkling her nose. Sometimes, just for fun, I put a little blue kerchief on her and knot it at the chin, and then adorable says it all. Mama! <br><br>High in one wall were two small windows. The panes were grimed black with soot and hard to see through, but she could make out that it was still night. She could also hear the quickening pace of the traffic in the street and knew from long habit that another workday was set to begin. The shop above would be opening, perhaps people would be coming down the steep wooden steps into the basement. People down the steps, maybe man-people, big feet, big shoes. Thump. She had to hurry, and&#x2014;let's have this out now&#x2014;not just because she was not keen on being caught by the sailors and kicked again or worse. She had to hurry especially because of the huge thing that was going on inside of her. Well, not a thing exactly, though there were indeed things inside of her (thirteen of them), more like a process, the sort of happening that people, with their enormous sense of humor, call a Blessed Event. A Blessed Event was about to occur, there was no question about it. The only question is, whose blessed event was it? Hers? Or mine? For most of my life I was convinced it had to have been anybody's but mine. But leaving me aside&#x2014;oh, if only I could!&#x2014;and returning to the situation in the basement: there was the Blessed Event on the verge of happening, and the question was what Flo (Mama) was going to do about it. <br><br>Well, I'll tell you what she did about it.&nbsp; <br><br>She went over to the shelf nearest the little cave in back of the warm metal thing and pulled down the biggest book she could get her paws on. She pulled it out and opened it, and holding a page down with her feet she tore it into confetti with her teeth. She did this with a second page, and a third. But here I detect a doubt. How, I hear you asking, do I know that she chose the biggest book? Well, as Jeeves likes to say, it is a question of the psychology of the individual, who in this case is Flo, my impending mother. "Rotund" was, I fear, too kind. She was disgustingly overweight, and just the daily grind of stoking all that fat had made her horribly edgy. Edgy and piggy. Urged on by the voracious clamor of millions of starving cells, she was always sure to grab the biggest slice of anything, even if she was already stuffed to the gills and could only nibble at the edges. Spoiled it for everyone else, of course. So rest assured, the biggest volume around is the one she went for. <br><br>Sometimes I like to think that the first moments of my struggle toward existence were accompanied, as by a triumphal march, by the shredding of Moby-Dick. That would account for the extreme adventurousness of my nature. At other times, when I am feeling particularly outcast and freakish, I am convinced that Don Quixote is the culprit. Just listen to this: "In short, he so immersed himself in those romances that he spent whole days and nights over his books; and thus with little sleeping and much reading, his brains dried up to such a degree that he lost the use of his reason. Having lost his wits completely, he stumbled upon the oddest fancy that had ever entered a madman's brain. He believed that it was necessary, both for his own honor and the service of the state, that he should become a knight-errant." Behold the Knight of Rueful Figure: fatuous, pigheaded, clownish, naive to the point of blindness, idealistic to the point of grotesqueness&#x2014;and who is that if not me in a nutshell? The truth is, I have never been right in the head. Only I don't charge windmills. I do worse: I dream of charging windmills, I long to charge windmills, and sometimes even I imagine I have charged windmills. Windmills or the mills of culture or&#x2014;let's say it&#x2014;those most delectable of all unconquerable objects, those erotic grinders, lascivious little mills of lust, carnal factories of kinky joys, fantasylands of frustrated fornicators, my Lovelies' own bodies. And what difference does it make in the end? A hopeless cause is a hopeless cause. But I won't obsess about that now. I'll obsess about it later. <br><br>Mama had made a huge pile of paper and with great effort was dragging and shoving it back into that little dark cavern she had found. And here we must not allow ourselves to become so distracted by the doleful cacophony of her portly grunts and wheezes as to lose sight of the fundamental question: where did all that paper come from? Whose broken words and shattered sentences did Mama churn into the indecipherable melange that, moments later, would cushion my fall into existence? I am straining my eyes to see. It is very dark in that place where she has pushed the pile and where now she is busy stamping it down in the middle and humping it up at the edges, and I can see it clearly only by leaning over the precipice that is the moment I was born. I am looking down at it from a great height, screwing up my imagination into a kind of telescope. I think I see it. Yes, I recognize it now. Dear Flo has made confetti of Finnegans Wake. Joyce was a Big One, maybe the Biggest One. I was birthed, bedded, and suckled on the defoliated carcass of the world's most unread masterpiece. <br><br>Mine was a large family, and soon thirteen of us were cruddled in its struins, to speak like itself, "chippy young cuppinjars cluttering round, clottering for their creams." (And after all these years, here I am hard at it still&#x2014;clottering, dottering, for my creams, my crumbs. O dreams!) All of us were soon fighting it out over twelve tits: Sweeny, Chucky, Luweena, Feenie, Mutt, Peewee, Shunt, Pudding, Elvis, Elvina, Humphrey, Honeychild, and Firmin (that's me, the thirteenth child). I remember them all so well. They were monsters. Even blind and naked, especially naked, their limbs bulged with sinew and muscle, or so it seemed to me at the time. I alone was born with my eyes wide open and clothed in a modest coat of soft gray fur. I was also puny. And take it from me, being puny is a terrible thing when you are little.</p><h2>Jewelry Designs from Nature: Woodlands, Gardens, Sea: Art Bead Jewelry Designs Inspired by Nature</h2><p>In <i>Jewelry Designs from Nature</i>, Heather Powers reveals her creative process and guides readers through 30 nature inspired bracelet, necklace and earring projects.

The grim world that fashion-model-turned-journalist Bing (Harper's, L.A. Weekly) limns here has little of the romance of such Hollywood variants as Colors; in fact, as G-roc, Bing's main informant, says, ``That movie just made up a lotta bullshit.'' Here, instead, the portrait is down and dirty and true as Bing lets gang members speak for themselves and at length, weaving their stories together with a lively scene-setting narrative that reveals her deep caring for these violent youths. Bing alternates interviews with kids jailed at youth ``camps,'' and later at Soledad Prison, with ones drawn from the mean streets of South Central L.A., and sifts into the stories a history of the gangs (begun in the late 1960's by one Raymond Washington, who organized ``a little gang of kids'' at Fremont High School that metastasized into today's sprawling cancer of 37 Blood ``sets'' and 57 Crip sets --Bloods and Crips being deadly enemies--with membership numbering in the many thousands). While the testimonies Bing elicits are always fascinating--shocking in their embrace of violence (asked for good reasons to kill, gang members answer, ``For the way he walk''; ``Cause he called me a baboon--dis' me''; ``Cause he fucked up my hair in the barbershop'') and frightening for the deep alienation they reveal--they exhibit a cumulatively numbing sameness. However, Bing's climactic interview, with imprisoned legendary ``gangbanger'' Monster Kody, provocatively freshens the text as Kody's highly political words (``My real enemy--The United States Government. That's who controls the Crips, the Bloods, and me'') indicate that today's gang member may be tomorrow's radical. Sobering, noteworthy dispatches from a urban inferno that's so without pity as to prompt one of Bing's subjects, age 17, to conclude, ``I tell you this--you seen enough dyin', then you ready to die yourself, just so you don't have to see no more of death.'' -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Bing is a gutsy reporter. For the past four years, she has been reporting on gang life in the Los Angeles area for the L.A. Weekly and apparently has gained the complete trust of the two major gangs, the "Crips" and the "Bloods." She tells the story of individual gang members, such as G-Roc, Baby Track, and Bianca, real people caught up in an astonishing real war occurring daily in California. The common elements running through all their stories are poverty, lack of family cohesion, lack of societal and individual respect, and drugs. This is not an in-depth sociological study, attempting to find the roots of "gang life," but rather a very colorful portrait of a disturbing subculture. It belongs in comprehensive collections of studies of gang life. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 4/15/91.<br><i>- Sandra K.

It is also important for its burgeoning population and its natural resources. Few can argue that its politics are not fascinating.</p> <p>The years from 1938 to 1957 were the most primitive period of rule by the Texas Establishment, a loosely knit plutocracy of the Anglo upper classes answering only to the vested interests in banking, oil, land development, law, the merchant houses, and the press. Establishment rule was reflected in numerous and harsh antilabor laws, the suppression of academic freedom, a segregationist philosophy, elections marred by demagoguery and corruption, the devolution of the daily press, and a state government that offered its citizens, especially minorities, very few services. Important elements in the contemporary political scene originated between 1938 and 1957.</p></p><p><p><strong>George Norris Green</strong> is Professor of History in the University of Texas at Arlington.

G. Wells</h2><p>It is now more than 70 years since H. G. Wells founded modern science-fiction with the brilliant succession of novels and short stories that ended in the first decade of this century. Even though two generations have gone by since these stories were first written, they still remain in the first rank. It is safe to say that very few writers have equaled Wells's achievement, and no one has excelled it. The stories of H. G. Wells are a timeless achievement that stand as high as they ever have.<br>This present collection contains the best of H. G. Wells's science-fiction short stories: favorites like "The Crystal Egg," "Aepyornis Island," "The Strange Orchid," "The Man Who Could Work Miracles," "A Dream of Armageddon," "The Sea Raiders," and eleven other tales about fourth-dimensional adventure, biological monstrosities, marvelous inventions, time distortions, cosmic catastrophe, and similar events.<br>In addition to these seventeen short stories, several of which could be called short novels, the full novel "The Invisible Man" is also included. One of the most popular of Wells's stories, as a serious study of egotism it ranks as high as it does as a science-fiction thriller.</p><p>A pioneer of science fiction, H. G. Wells (1866-1946) wrote thrilling adventures about time travel, space exploration, alien invasion, and scientific experiments gone awry. His tales of obsession, revelation, and discovery remain compellingly readable and relevant.</p><h2>Billionaire Boy</h2><p>A hilarious, touching and extraordinary new fable from the author of The Boy in the Dress and Mr Stink.

Joe&#39;s got his own bowling alley, his own cinema, even his own butler who is also an orangutan. He&#39;s the wealthiest twelve-year-old in the land. But Joe isn&#39;t happy. Why not? Because he&#39;s got a billion pounds! and not a single friend. But then someone comes along, someone who likes Joe for Joe, not for his money. The problem is, Joe&#39;s about to learn that when money is involved, nothing is what it seems. The best things in life are free, they say -- and if Joe&#39;s not careful, he&#39;s going to lose them all!</p><p>David Walliams - comedian, actor and author - continues to take the children&#39;s literary world by storm.

For nearly a century, the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company was chief architect of the social, ethnic, and economic existence of Manchester, New Hampshire. In the early 1900s, it was the largest textile mill in the world, employing 17,000; its red brick facade stretched for nearly a mile along the Merrimack River and its payroll drew immigrants by the thousands. In their own words, laborers, foremen, managers, and town residents paint a detailed portrait of the mill&#x2019;s nearly feudal dominance of every aspect of their lives and offer their response to this existence, with fierce pride and an unshakable sense of community. When competition, labor unrest, and obsolescence caught up with the mill in 1936, a weaver recalls, &#x201c;the mills went out and the world stopped for everybody.&#x201d;</p><p>5 1/4 x 8 trim. 71 illus. 2 maps.

Now one scientist, Dan Sylveste, will stop at nothing to solve the Amarantin riddle before ancient history repeats itself. With no other resources at his disposal, Sylveste forges a dangerous alliance with the cyborg crew of the starship Nostalgia for Infinity. But as he closes in on the secret, a killer closes in on him because the Amarantin were destroyed for a reason. And if that reason is uncovered, the universe-and reality itself-could be irrevocably altered.</p><p>Alastair Reynolds's first novel is "hard" SF on an epic scale, crammed with technological marvels and immensities. Its events take place over a relatively short period, but have roots a billion years old--when the Dawn War ravaged our galaxy.<p> Sylveste is the only man ever to return alive and sane from a Shroud, an enclave in space protected by awesome gravity-warping defenses: "a folding a billion times less severe should have required more energy than was stored in the entire rest-mass of the galaxy."

I knew I would do all of that and summer would be the same and never the same. <br><br>Last summer we had a dad and a brother and then they were gone. <br><br>We did not see it coming.<br> 2.<br>One of the things Miles and I whisper-worried about at night was that our mom could fall in love again. <br><br>It didn&#x2019;t seem like it would happen because she&#x2019;d loved my father so much, but we had learned from the accident that any�thing could happen. Anything bad, anyway. <br><br>Mom didn&#x2019;t end up falling in love with a person, but she did fall in love with a house. We were in Iron Creek in June, visiting our grandparents&#x2014;my mom&#x2019;s parents&#x2014;when she saw the for sale sign while she was out for a drive. She came home and whispered to Gram and Papa, and then they went with her to see the house while Miles and I stayed with our uncle Nick and his wife. Two weeks later, Mom used some of the money from when my dad died, the life insurance money, to buy the house. Since she&#x2019;s a teacher and didn&#x2019;t have to go back to work until the end of August, she decided we would spend the rest of the summer in Iron Creek and all the summers after that. She planned to rent out the house to college students during the school year. We weren&#x2019;t really rich enough to have two houses.<br><br>&#x201c;It will be good for us to be around family more,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Next summer we can stay for the whole time.&#x201d; <br><br>We didn&#x2019;t fight her about it. We liked our grandparents. We liked our uncle and our aunt. They had known our dad and our brother Ben. They had some of the same memories we did. Sometimes they even brought things up, like, &#x201c;Remember when your dad went out in the kayak at Aspen Lake and he flipped over and we had to save him in our paddleboat?&#x201d; and we would all start laughing because we had the same picture in our minds, my dad with his sunglasses dangling from one ear and his hair all wet. And they knew that Ben&#x2019;s favorite kind of ice cream wasn&#x2019;t ice cream at all, it was rainbow sherbet, and he always ate green first, and so when I saw it in my grand�ma&#x2019;s freezer once and I started crying they didn&#x2019;t even ask why and I think I saw my uncle Nick, my mom&#x2019;s brother, crying too.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Mom said, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s go inside and choose rooms before we start unpacking.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Me first!&#x201d; said Miles. <br><br>They went in the house and I sat down on the steps. <br><br>The wind came through the trees, which were very old and very tall. I heard an ice-cream truck a few streets over, and kids playing in other yards. <br><br>And then a boy rode past on a bike. The boy wore old clothes. Not worn-out old, old-fashioned. He was dressed like a peasant. He had on a ruffly blouse and pants that ended right under his knees and a hat with a feather and he was my age. He didn&#x2019;t glance over at me. He looked happy. <br> <i><br>Sad, </i>I thought. <i>That&#x2019;s so sad. He&#x2019;s weird and he doesn&#x2019;t even know it. </i><br><br>Actually, it&#x2019;s better not to know it. My brother Ben was different and he knew. <br><br>The trees sounded loud as a waterfall above me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re so lucky,&#x201d; Mom kept telling us when she bought the house. &#x201c;The trees on the property have been there for fifty years. They&#x2019;re beautiful. Not many like them in the whole town.&#x201d; <br><br>I think she noticed the trees because my dad always loved trees.<br><br>We bought the house from a family who had lived in Iron Creek for generations, the Wainwrights. The kids had all moved away but one of them came back to sell the house when his mother died. He didn&#x2019;t want to live in it, but he was also kind of weird about selling it. When he ran into my mother at the real�tor&#x2019;s office, he told her, &#x201c;It will always be the <i>Wainwright </i>home.&#x201d; <br><br>My mother said she nodded at him like she agreed but she didn&#x2019;t waste any time having the velvety green carpet torn up and the hardwood floors underneath sanded and varnished. <br><br>&#x201c;I want the heart and the bones to stay the same,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Anything else, we can change. <i>We </i>live here now.&#x201d; <br><br>She also had the front door painted blue.<br><br>I heard that blue front door open behind me and Mom came out. &#x201c;Hey, Cedar,&#x201d; she said. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Miles picked his room,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;There are still two left. Want to go next?&#x201d; <br> <i><br>Shouldn&#x2019;t </i>you <i>go next? </i>I wanted to ask, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. Her room could be as small as ours now because she didn&#x2019;t have to share. <br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said, because I knew she wanted me to say <i>Sure</i>. <br><br>Inside, the house was empty, no furniture yet. Living room to the right, stairs in front of me. &#x201c;Want to look around down�stairs first?&#x201d; Mom asked, because Miles and I hadn&#x2019;t spent time here yet, but I shook my head and started climbing. When I got to the top of the steps, I stopped. <br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it fun?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I left these the way they were. I couldn&#x2019;t help it.&#x201d; <br><br>Each bedroom door was painted a different color. One yel�low, one purple, one green. The bathroom door was painted red. &#x201c;Are the rooms inside the same colors?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Only the doors. Each room has something special about it, though.&#x201d; <br><br>Right then the green door opened. &#x201c;I picked this one,&#x201d; Miles said, sticking his head out. &#x201c;It has a big, big closet. Like a hideout. For me.&#x201d; Miles was eight, young enough to still care about hideouts.<br><br>&#x201c;So green is gone,&#x201d; Mom said. <br><br>I didn&#x2019;t care which room I had but I knew she wanted me to pick. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do this one,&#x201d; I said, pointing to the purple door at the end of the hall. <br><br>&#x201c;You can check them both first,&#x201d; Mom said. <br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Unless you wanted purple?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I like them both,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;The yellow room has a win�dow seat. The purple room has a diamond window.&#x201d; <br><br>That settled it. I knew Mom had always liked window seats and our real house, up in a suburb of Salt Lake City four hours away, was newish and beige and had no window seats anywhere. <br><br>&#x201c;Purple,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a rainbow up here.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what made me want to paint the front door blue,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;It was the only color that was missing.&#x201d; <br><br>Lots of colors were missing. Pink. Orange. Brown. Gray. But I didn&#x2019;t say that.<br> 3.<br> It turned out that a diamond window was not a window shaped like a diamond, which is what I assumed it would be. It was a big, regular-shaped window that opened outward, but instead of having two big panes of glass it had lots of small panes of glass, and <i>those </i>were diamond shaped. <br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t see out clearly because of all the shapes and that bugged me, so I opened up the window. The wind in the trees was relentless. It sounded like an ocean outside my window so I closed it again. <br><br>Because of that stupid window, it felt like the house was a fly with those eyes that have a million parts. And it was looking at me. <br><br>I&#x2019;d picked the wrong room. I should have done yellow. <br><br>Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something move. Something big, and black, and outside my window. <br><br>It was in the tree. I took a step closer. And then closer again. <br><br>The thing stretched its wings and settled. I could see that much, even though the window made it smeary and bleary and in diamonds. <br><br>I took another step. <br><br>I wanted to open the window to see what the thing was, but I also didn&#x2019;t want it to fly in. <br><br>Another step. The thing outside the window turned its head. <br><br>The purple door slammed open behind me and I spun around to see Miles. &#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Gram and Papa and Uncle Nick and Aunt Kate are here! They&#x2019;re going to help us unpack!&#x201d; <br><br>I looked back at the window but this time it only showed me trees. Something had looked away.<br> 4.<br>&#x201c;What room would Ben have picked?&#x201d; Miles asked at breakfast the next day. <br><br>Ben loved blue, he would have picked blue for sure, but there was no blue room. <br><br>And then I knew the real reason we had a blue front door. <br><br>&#x201c;Maybe mine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Purple is closest to blue.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Maybe not to Ben,&#x201d; Miles said, and he was right. You could never be sure how Ben would see things. He had his own kind of logic. <br><br>We were getting better at talking about Ben, but not much. Better because we did talk about him but also there was so much more to say and we were all still too fragile to say it. <br><br>After lunch I sat outside and I saw the boy on the bike ride by again, and he didn&#x2019;t see me that time either. And he still had on the same clothes and he still looked happy. <br><br>Next day, same thing all over again. Boy, bike, clothes, happy. <br><br>In my family we never call people names because some�times people used to call Ben names and we all hated that. When he was younger he didn&#x2019;t notice so much, but when he was nine, the year he died, he noticed every single time. You&#x2019;d see his eyes flicker. He&#x2019;d take it in. And then who knew what he&#x2019;d do with it. Or how it made him feel. <br><br>Here is something bad about me. <br><br>I call people names in my head sometimes. <br><br>I don&#x2019;t do it to be mean. <br><br>I do it to label. <br><br>But I know names-to-label are bad too. Names-to-be-mean are worse, but both are bad. <br><br>Here&#x2019;s the name I called the boy in my head: <br><br>Nerd-on-a-Bike.<br> 5.<br> &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Miles said. &#x201c;I found this in my closet.&#x201d; He dragged something into the middle of my bedroom. Outside, the wind blew and the sky had gone dark. A thunderstorm was moving in. <br><br>It was a box of old board games. <br><br>&#x201c;Remember,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;you may play these games, but they will always be <i>Wainwright </i>board games.&#x201d; <br><br>We spread the games out on the floor. Outside the trees went crazy. The storm was almost here. <br><br>&#x201c;Your room is noisy,&#x201d; Miles said. <br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the trees.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You could ask Mom to trade rooms,&#x201d; Miles said. <br><br>But he knew I wouldn&#x2019;t do that. He knew I wouldn&#x2019;t ask Mom for anything I didn&#x2019;t really, really need. We both tried to be good for her and she tried to be patient with us. Sometimes I thought of the three of us as pencils with the erasers scrubbed down to the end, and the next swipe across the paper would tear through the page and make a <i>scree </i>sound across the desk. <br><br>It turned out most of the games were missing parts. But there was a very old version of Life that had everything in it. We played a few rounds before we got bored. <br><br>&#x201c;Is there anything else in your closet?&#x201d; I asked Miles. <br><br>&#x201c;A box of old dolls,&#x201d; Miles said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all broken up. Arms and legs sticking out. Eyes that won&#x2019;t close anymore.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Are you serious?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s only a box of old clothes. Like dress-up clothes. And some shoes. The shoes are gross. They&#x2019;re all curly.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Show me,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>He was right. The shoes were disgusting. They looked like elf shoes, twisted up and pointy. And the dress-up clothes smelled musty. They all seemed like they were from our parents&#x2019; era, except one shiny blue dress that was fancier than the rest and probably older. It had fur on the cuffs and the collar. I couldn&#x2019;t tell if the fur was real or fake. I hung that dress up in Miles&#x2019;s closet so it wouldn&#x2019;t be so wrinkled. It was kind of pretty. <br><br>&#x201c;Want to walk to the gas station and get a Fireball?&#x201d; Miles asked when I was done. <br><br>Miles was into Fireballs, the huge red kind that you get at convenience stores. Tears ran down his face while he ate them because he couldn&#x2019;t stand how hot they were but he wanted to suck all the way through one without stopping by the end of the summer. Since the house was in the middle of town, we didn&#x2019;t have to walk far to get to a gas station, which meant that Miles had learned quickly about every kind of cheap candy, like Lemonheads and Necco Wafers and gum shredded to look like tobacco. My mom wouldn&#x2019;t let him get the gum, or the candy cigarettes.<br><br>I liked Lemonheads best. They were so sour they made my nose sweat.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s raining,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; Miles said. &#x201c;The rain will feel good.&#x201d;<br><br>I decided to stay put.<br><br>I stayed put a lot, ever since last summer. My mom worried about it because she thought it meant that I was afraid to go out, because of what happened to my dad and Ben.<br><br>I walked over and opened the window. Even with the wind. Even with the rain. I felt like I might as well let all that sound surround me. I curled up on the bed and waited to see if the house would look at me again.<br><br>The black thing came back. This time, in the daylight, I could see what it was.<br><br>It was a bird.<br><br>It was a vulture.<br><br>I had never seen one up close but I recognized it from mov�ies. Or TV. I wasn&#x2019;t sure how I knew, but I did.<br><br>It looked at me. It probably wasn&#x2019;t used to anyone living in my room, because no one had for a while. It watched me and the house watched me. <br><br>If the vulture wanted, it could fly right inside. <br><br>&#x201c;<i>I&#x2019;m not afraid of you,&#x201d; </i>I whispered. <br><br>It cocked its ugly red head. <br><br>It knew I lied.</p><h2>Grover&#39;s book of cute little baby animals (Sesame Street book club)</h2><p>Glossy hardcover no dust jacket.1992 10.25x7.90x0.30 TRIP FOR CHILDREN IN THE LIBRARY, AND READ ABOUT KITTEN, KOALAS, KANGAROOS, CUBS, AND MORE.</p><p></p><h2>Dry Place: Landscapes Of Belonging And Exclusion</h2><p>Landscape is the space of negotiation between human beings and the physical world, and rarely are the negotiations more complex and subtle than those conducted through the desert landscape along the Mexico-U.S. border.Patricia L. Price views the shaping of the landscape on and around the border through various narratives that have sought to establish claims to these dry lands. Most prominent are the accounts of Anglo-American expansionism and Manifest Destiny juxtaposed with the Chicano nationalist tale of Aztl�n in the twentieth century, all constituting collective, contending claims to the U.S. Southwest. Demonstrating how stories can become vehicles for reshaping places and identities, Price considers characters old and new who inhabit the contemporary borderlands between Mexico and the United States-ranging from longstanding manifestations of good and evil in the figures of the Virgin of Guadalupe and the Devil to a collection of lay saints embodying current concerns.Dry Place weaves together theoretical insights with field-based inquiry, autobiography, and creative writing to arrive at a textured understanding of the bordered landscape of late modern subjectivity.Patricia L.

Ferguson, who electrified the world with his Oscar-winning documentary <i><b>Inside Job</b></i>, now explains how a predator elite took over the country, step by step, and he exposes the networks of academic, financial, and political influence, in <i>all</i> recent administrations, that prepared the predators&#x2019; path to conquest.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Over the last several decades, the United States has undergone one of the most radical social and economic transformations in its history.&nbsp; <br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finance has become America&#x2019;s dominant industry, while manufacturing, even for high technology industries, has nearly disappeared.<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The financial sector has become increasingly criminalized, with the widespread fraud that caused the housing bubble going completely unpunished.<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal tax collections as a share of GDP are at their lowest level in sixty years, with the wealthy and highly profitable corporations enjoying the greatest tax reductions.<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most shockingly, the United States, so long the beacon of opportunity for the ambitious poor, has become one of the world&#x2019;s most unequal and unfair societies.&nbsp;<br><br> If you&#x2019;re smart and a hard worker, but your parents aren&#x2019;t rich, you&#x2019;re now better off being born in Munich, Germany or in Singapore than in Cleveland, Ohio or New York.<br> This radical shift did not happen by accident.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ferguson shows how, since the Reagan administration in the 1980s, both major political parties have become captives of the moneyed elite.&nbsp; It was the Clinton administration that dismantled the regulatory controls that protected the average citizen from avaricious financiers.&nbsp; It was the Bush team that destroyed the federal revenue base with its grotesquely skewed tax cuts for the rich. And it is the Obama White House that has allowed financial criminals to continue to operate unchecked, even after supposed &#x201c;reforms&#x201d; installed after the collapse of 2008. <br><br> <i><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Predator Nation</b></i> reveals how once-revered figures like Alan Greenspan and Larry Summers became mere courtiers to the elite.&nbsp; Based on many newly released court filings, it details the extent of the crimes&#x2014;there is no other word&#x2014;committed in the frenzied chase for wealth that caused the financial crisis.&nbsp; And, finally, it lays out a plan of action for how we might take back our country and the American dream.</p><p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Simon Johnson on <em>Predator Nation</em> by Charles H. Ferguson</strong> <br> <em><strong>Simon Johnson</strong> is coauthor of </em>13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown<em> and </em>White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters To You. <p><em>Predator Nation</em> demolishes the view that the global financial crisis was merely some sort of freak accident. Charles Ferguson makes a convincing case that the world&#x2019;s banking system was brought to the brink of complete collapse in 2008&#x2013;09 by a virulent combination of unchecked greed and criminal behavior.</p> <p>This is an epic crime story with an apparently clean getaway, courtesy of the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Both presidents proved unwilling to hold anyone to account&#x2014;or even to launch meaningful investigations.</p> <p>Leading bankers walked away with billions of dollars in unjustified compensation. The costs imposed on the rest of us can be measured in the trillions of dollars.</p> <p><em>Predator Nation</em> provides a roadmap for prosecution, systematically covering the banks involved, the names of culpable executives, the obvious crimes, the precise laws broken, and the evidence hiding in plain sight. No doubt it will be widely ignored by our legal officials.</p> <p>Ferguson&#x2019;s points are also intensely political. Reckless behavior by bankers can be traced back to the bipartisan consensus around deregulating finance in recent decades. This result is a socially destructive industry with immense political power&#x2014;and capable of defeating all attempts at meaningful reform. The continued predominance of rogue finance is greatly facilitated by its effective corruption of American academia and many so-called &#x201c;independent experts&#x201d; (documented in Charles Ferguson&#x2019;s Oscar-winning movie, <em>Inside Job</em>.)</p> <p>Big banks hold American politics in a death grip.

A distinguished businesswoman and writer, she examines the phenomenon and traces its imprint in our private and working lives, and within governments and organizations, and asks: What makes us prefer ignorance? What are we so afraid of? Why do some people see more than others? And how can we change?<br>Covering everything from our choice of mates to the SEC, Bernard Madoff's investors, the embers of BP's refinery, the military in Afghanistan, and the dog-eat-dog world of subprime mortgage lenders, this provocative book demonstrates how failing to see--or admit to ourselves or our colleagues--the issues and problems in plain sight can ruin private lives and bring down corporations. Heffernan explains how willful blindness develops before exploring ways that institutions and individuals can combat it. In the tradition of Malcolm Gladwell and Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Margaret Heffernan's <i>Willful Blindness</i> is a tour de force on human behavior that will open your eyes.</p></p><p><p><b>Margaret Heffernan</b> has been the CEO of several businesses. Born in Texas and educated at Cambridge University, she worked for BBC Radio for five years where she wrote, directed, produced, and commissioned dozens of documentaries and dramas. Heffernan is author of <i>The Naked Truth: A Working Woman's Manifesto on Business and What Really Matters</i> and <i>How She Does It: How Women Entrepreneurs Are Changing the Rules of Business Success</i>, and is a regular contributor to <i>Real Business</i> and <i>Fast Company</i> magazine.</p>groups were asked to assess how much they thought they would like the people whose faces they&#x2019;d seen if they were to meet them in the future. They were also asked how far they believed those people to be similar to themselves. <br>&nbsp;<br>The students who had seen the same face for four weeks believed more strongly that these were people they would like in real life. They also believed (on no evidence except the photograph) that those faces belonged to people who were similar to themselves. In other words, the familiar faces&#x2014; with no supporting evidence&#x2014; felt nicer. Women responded to the experiment in exactly the same way as men. A similar experiment, using irregular octagons, generated the same pattern of responses. The familiar makes us feel secure and comfortable. <br>&nbsp;<br>This even pertains when we go looking for emotional experiences, as when we listen to music. It can be hard fully to enjoy a new piece the first time you listen to it; only after repeated hearings does it become a favorite. Part of that may be because if you&#x2019;re trying out, say, Mahler&#x2019;s Eighth Symphony for the first time, there is a lot to take in: two orchestras, two choirs, and eight soloists over eighty minutes won&#x2019;t create an instant impression. And listening to music is a hugely complex cognitive exercise. Even the White Stripes&#x2019; &#x201c;Seven Nation Army&#x201d; can take some getting used to. But once we&#x2019;ve heard it a few times, we&#x2019;re used to it and like it. And then we don&#x2019;t want something different. We want more of the same. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We score hundreds of attributes of every song,&#x201d; says Tim Westergren, the founder of Pandora Internet Radio. &#x201c;And then we find the matches between those songs&#x2014; and then that&#x2019;s what we recommend to you. Because we know that if you liked one piece of music, you are very, very likely to like another one that shares the same characteristics.&#x201d; Westergren&#x2019;s business does for music what eHarmony does for dating. Each song is scored manually by musicians for some four hundred attributes; there are thirty for the voice alone, capturing everything from timbre to layers of the voice to vibrato. Then that &#x201c;score&#x201d; is matched to other songs that have scores that are as closely similar as possible. Pandora software is doing to music what we do when we meet people: looking for matches. And, when it finds them, people feel very happy. &#x201c;God, I love Pandora!&#x201d; said Joe Clayton, a music fan in Boston. &#x201c;I love it. I&#x2019;m always finding new bands, new stuff that I just couldn&#x2019;t find otherwise&#x2014; certainly not in any music store. And it&#x2019;s kinda creepy&#x2014; but in a good way&#x2014; because they almost never give me something I don&#x2019;t like. Almost never.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>More than fifty million people use Pandora, and many are avid evangelists. But what Pandora can&#x2019;t do is come up with that serendipitous suggestion that introduces you to something completely different from anything you&#x2019;ve ever heard before. I like Bruce Springsteen, Frank Zappa, and the White Stripes&#x2014; but I also adore Handel. And given my first three preferences, Pandora wouldn&#x2019;t ever offer me Handel. Westergren acknowledges that limitation. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re never going to take you from rock and roll to baroque music. Pandora is about broadening your selection&#x2014; but narrowing your taste. If you like jazz, you like more jazz. If you like hip- hop, you like more hip- hop. But Pandora is never going to take you from Springsteen to Handel.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>All personalization software, whether eHarmony, Pandora, Amazon&#x2019;s book recommendations, or MyShape .com&#x2019;s clothing suggestions, does the same thing: makes our lives easier by reducing overwhelming choice. And software is doing it the same way that our brain does, by searching for matches. It&#x2019;s as though, online and off - line, our life is one gigantic game of Snap! This is immensely efficient: It means that the brain can take shortcuts because it is working with what it already knows, not having to start from scratch. When we find what we like, part of our plea sure is the joy of recognition. <br>&nbsp;<br>But the flip side of that satisfaction is that we are rejecting a lot along the way. As Westergren says, we are narrowing our taste, reducing the music or books or clothes or people that might widen our horizons. Our brains aren&#x2019;t designed to draw us into experiences that are wild and different; there would be no advantage in doing something so risky. And so, by focusing in one direction and excluding others, we become blind to the experiences that don&#x2019;t match. <br>&nbsp;<br>This is not to say that strange, serendipitous things never flow into our lives. Of course they do. You meet someone at work who introduces you to Handel and you develop a love of baroque music. Or&#x2014; more likely&#x2014; your son introduces you to Rammstein. But these encounters are random and risky. Remember Robert&#x2019;s problem with Albanian women. <br>&nbsp;<br>There&#x2019;s a circle here: We like ourselves, not least because we are known and familiar to ourselves. So we like people similar to us&#x2014; or that we just imagine might have some attributes in common with us. They feel familiar too, and safe. And those feelings of familiarity and security make us like ourselves more because we aren&#x2019;t anxious. We belong. Our self- esteem rises. We feel happy. Human beings want to feel good about themselves and to feel safe, and being surrounded by familiarity and similarity satisfies those needs very efficiently. The problem with this is that everything outside that warm, safe circle is our blind spot. <br>&nbsp;<br>Because not only are we rejecting music that doesn&#x2019;t match; we use these same processes to make important decisions in our everyday lives. When I had my first opportunity, as a producer at the BBC, to choose my own team, I hoped to hire people who would challenge me and each other and who would invest the entire project with intellectual richness and vigor. With all that firmly in mind, I selected liberal arts graduates who were all female, spoke several languages, and had birthdays within the same week in June. In other words, they were all like me. <br>&nbsp;<br>Did I consciously intend to do that? Of course not. Like hiring managers the world over, I intended to hire only the best and the brightest and that&#x2019;s what I thought I was looking for. But did I also want people I&#x2019;d feel comfortable working with, enjoy spending late hours with, people who shared the values of the project? Well, yes. I was biased, in favor of those just like me. Everyone is biased. But just as we are affronted when told that we&#x2019;re likely to marry and associate with those very similar to ourselves, so most people vehemently reject the idea that they are biased: others may be, but not us. &#x201c;And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother&#x2019;s eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?&#x201d; is how the Bible puts it. Of course we consider the people who disagree with us to be the most biased of all. <br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s recently become easier to identify and mea sure biases with a suite of tests called the Implicit Association Test, or IAT for short. Designed by three psychologists, the computer- based tests examine thoughts and feelings that exist outside of our conscious awareness or control.9 These may pertain to gender, age, race, or religion. In the test, participants are given two sets of images and two lists of words&#x2014; one positive, one negative. Images and words appear randomly on the screen and you have to associate them with positives or negatives. You may link &#x201c;male&#x201d; with &#x201c;intelligent&#x201d; or &#x201c;old&#x201d; with &#x201c;stupid.&#x201d; When making a link that isn&#x2019;t comfortable for us, we take longer. And that delay, say the researchers, is telling: it takes more time to overcome bias. The longer we take to accept a match, the greater our bias. <br>&nbsp;<br>Since 1998, more than 4.5 million people have taken these tests and the researchers have found that bias is pervasive among all of us, whether we think we&#x2019;re biased or not. White physicians are friendlier toward anonymous white patients than toward black ones. Seventy percent of citizens in thirty- four countries associate science more with men than with women. More than 80 percent of us have a bias against the elderly. Ordinary people (including the researchers who direct the project) harbor negative associations in relation to various social groups even though they say they don&#x2019;t and often wish, quite earnestly, not to. We see this play out in daily life everywhere. Go into any major corporation and look around. Despite de cades of diversity campaigns and millions of dollars invested in programs to make recruitment and retention less biased and more equitable, the homogeneity of most companies is overwhelming. Look at the lists of where the graduates of Harvard Business School or Wharton go and you will see the same phenomenon: armies marching into banks, financial institutions, consulting firms, year after year. <br>&nbsp;<br>This is one reason why, despite a great deal of goodwill and commitment and even, in some countries, equality legislation, it has proved so hard to shift women into top roles, shovel venture capital into ethnic businesses, or train a lot of male midwives. It isn&#x2019;t the only reason, of course, but the fact that we like people like ourselves, are unconsciously biased in their favor, makes a big impact. Ste reo types are energy-saving devices; they let us make shortcuts that feel just fine. That&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re so persistent. <br>&nbsp;<br>The famous development of blind auditions for new symphony members provided graphic illustration of this point. Harvard economist Claudia Goldin and Prince ton&#x2019;s Cecilia Rouse found that when musicians were allowed to audition behind screens, where their gender could not influence the evaluation of their music, women&#x2019;s chances of making it through the first round increased by 50 percent&#x2014; and in the final rounds by <i>300 </i>percent. Blind auditions have now become standard in the United States, with the result that the number of female players in major orchestras has increased from 5 percent to 36 percent. <br>&nbsp;<br>In Europe, that practice is not ubiquitous&#x2014; and many musicians argue that this perpetuates both gender and ethnic discrimination. Some of this bias isn&#x2019;t even implicit: The Vienna Philharmonic did not accept women until twelve years ago and even now only 2 percent of its 137 musicians are women. Moreover, despite the recent rise to prominence of many brilliant Asian musicians, the Philharmonic has never hired a visible &#x201c;non- Aryan&#x201d; because it feels that such individuals would &#x201c;destroy the ensemble&#x2019;s image of Austrian authenticity.&#x201d; Even white male musicians say that white male musicians prefer white male musicians. Music may be a universal language but not, apparently, universally. <br>&nbsp;<br>The many voices arguing in favor of diversity in recent years have not been motivated only, or even primarily, by notions of social justice. The argument for diversity is that if you bring together lots of different kinds of people, with a wide range of education and experience, they can identify more solutions, see more alternatives to problems, than any single person or homogenous group ever could. Groups have the potential, in other words, to be smarter than individuals; that&#x2019;s the case put forward so compellingly by James Surowiecki in his book, <i>The Wisdom of Crowds</i>. But the problem is that, as our biases keep informing whom we hire and promote, we weed out that diversity and are left with skyscrapers full of people pretty much the same. <br>&nbsp;<br>Just as we choose to work with people very like ourselves, we choose to live among them also. The psychologist David Myers says that the way we move around and build neighborhoods mirrors the way we choose our spouses. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mobility enables the sociological equivalent of &#x2018;assortative mating,&#x2019; &#x201d; he says. Now that we enjoy so much freedom to move around, choosing the jobs that we like, we can also choose the communities that we like. And by and large we choose &#x201c;those places and people that are comfortably akin to ourselves.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Across the United States, the journalist Bill Bishop studied this pattern and found that over the last thirty years, most Americans had been engaged in moving toward more homogenous ways of living, &#x201c;clustering in communities of like- mindedness.&#x201d; He calls this &#x201c;the big sort&#x201d; and what strikes him is how well defended these communities can be. When a lone Republican neighbor, living in a staunchly Democratic part of Austin, Texas, dared to articulate his political opinion in a local LISTSERV, the response he got was unambiguous: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really not interested [in] being surprised by right- wing e-mail in my in box, no matter what its guise. It makes me feel bad, and I don&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d;15 As we have either more freedom or less security in our work, we move more. In 2008, thirty-four million people&#x2014; 11.9 percent of the population&#x2014; moved, and that was the lowest rate of migration since 1959. And when people move, they mostly choose to live among people who like the same coffee shops, bookstores, festivals, and politics. When Bill Bishop went on to map this trend across the United States, his data revealed that the preference people have for living with others like themselves made a clear impact on the political map of the country. Whereas in 1976, only 26 percent of people lived in landslide counties, by 2000 45.3 percent did. That didn&#x2019;t make for a lot of argument outside the polling stations. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;The neighborhood where we live,&#x201d; Rebecca says, &#x201c;is lovely. The neighbors are lovely. The family on the other side of us, Paul and Juliet&#x2014; they <i>are </i>us! Mid- thirties, two boys. Slightly younger but exactly parallel. Juliet doesn&#x2019;t work, but I&#x2019;m only part- time. The street is full of people like us. Each house is a carbon copy of the same kinds of people.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>When Rebecca and Robert were house- hunting, she recalls that they were driven by price, proximity to work, and choice of schools. All her neighbors were using the same parameters, so perhaps it isn&#x2019;t so surprising that they&#x2019;d all end up together. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I guess you could say that,&#x201d; Rebecca concedes. &#x201c;But there were other places that would have fit the bill. But when we came here, it was more than just functionality. We liked it here&#x2014; we still like it here. It feels right for us.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Bishop argues that we have come to demand living arrangements that won&#x2019;t challenge us. We seek confirmation and validation from those around us, even if it is just a matter of our pastimes. Wesleyan College in Connecticut caters to this desire, by offering twenty- eight different dorms organized around themes, including one for &#x201c;eclectic&#x201d; students. (Apparently even dislike of themes is a theme.) Colgate College in New York has a dorm for the lovers of foreign films. Affinity is a big draw. <br>&nbsp;<br>These dorms are merely mirroring what is happening in the communities from which these students come; real estate developers bank on it. They design neighborhoods such as Covenant Hills in Orange County for Christians so it boasts a Christian school. The more exotically named Terramor, on the other hand, aims to be one of the largest environmentally friendly developments in America, marketed to &#x201c;cultural creatives&#x201d; who want to send their children to its Montessori school. As nice as they may be, what the dorms and developments also do is narro...</p><h2>Heraldry</h2><p>Used Condition. 1st American Edition 1968.

She was the fifth child of Thomas and Elizabeth Strickland. Her siblings were Eliza, Jane Margaret, Susanna (later Susanna Moodie), Samuel, and Agnes. In 1832 she married Lt. Thomas Traill.

As you express a wish that I should give you a minute detail of our voyage, I shall take up my subject from the time of our embarkation, and write as inclination prompts me. Instead of having reason to complain of short letters, you will, I fear, fi nd mine only too prolix.<br>&nbsp;<br>After many delays and disappointments, we succeeded at last in obtaining a passage in a fast-sailing brig, the <i>Laurel</i>, of Greenock; and favourable winds are now rapidly carrying us across the Atlantic.<br>&nbsp;<br>The <i>Laurel </i>is not a regular passenger-ship, which I consider an advantage, for what we lose in amusement and variety we assuredly gain in comfort. The cabin is neatly fi tted up, and I enjoy the luxury (for such it is, compared with the narrow berths of the state cabin) of a handsome sofa, with crimson draperies, in the great cabin. The state cabin is also ours. We paid fi fteen pounds each for our passage to Montreal. This was high, but it includes every expense; and, in fact, we had no choice. The only vessel in the river bound for Canada, was a passenger-ship literally swarming with emigrants, chiefl y of the lower class of Highlanders.<br>&nbsp;<br>The only passengers besides ourselves in the <i>Laurel </i>are the captain&#x2019;s nephew, a pretty yellow-haired lad, about fi fteen years of age, who works his passage out, and a young gentleman who is going out as clerk in a merchant&#x2019;s house in Quebec. He seems too much wrapped up in his own affairs to be very communicative to others; he walks much, talks little, and reads less; but often amuses himself by singing as he paces the deck, &#x201c;Home, sweet home,&#x201d; and that delightful song by Camoens, &#x201c;Isle of beauty.&#x201d; It is a sweet song, and I can easily imagine the charm it has for a home-sick heart.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was much pleased with the scenery of the Clyde; the day we set sail was a lovely one, and I remained on deck till nightfall. The morning light found our vessel dashing gallantly along, with a favourable breeze, through the north channel; that day we saw the last of the Hebrides, and before night lost sight of the north coast of Ireland. A wide expanse of water and sky is now our only prospect, unvaried by any object save the distant and scarcely to be traced outline of some vessel just seen at the verge of the horizon, a speck in the immensity of space, or sometimes a few sea-fowl. I love to watch these wanderers of the ocean, as they rise and fall with the rocking billows, or fl it about our vessel; and often I wonder whence they came, to what distant shore they are bound, and if they make the rude wave their home and resting-place during the long day and dark night; and then I recall to mind the words of the American poet, Bryant, &#x2013;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He who from zone to zone<br>Guides through the boundless air their certain fl ight,<br>In the long way that I must tread alone<br>Will guide my steps aright.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Though we have been little more than a week on board, I am getting weary of the voyage. I can only compare the monotony of it to being weather-bound in some country inn. I have already made myself acquainted with all the books worth reading in the ship&#x2019;s library; unfortunately, it is chiefl y made up with old novels and musty romances.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the weather is fi ne I sit on a bench on the deck, wrapped in my cloak, and sew, or pace the deck with my husband, and talk over plans for the future, which in all probability will never be realized. I really do pity men who are not actively employed: women have always their needle as a resource against the overwhelming weariness of an idle life; but where a man is confi ned to a small space, such as the deck and cabin of a trading vessel, with nothing to see, nothing to hear, nothing to do, and nothing to read, he is really a very pitiable creature.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is one passenger on board that seems perfectly happy, if one may judge from the liveliness of the songs with which he greets us whenever we approach his cage. It is &#x201c;Harry,&#x201d; the captain&#x2019;s goldfi nch &#x2013; &#x201c;the <i>captain&#x2019;s mate</i>,&#x201d; as the sailors term him. This pretty creature has made no fewer than twelve voyages in the <i>Laurel</i>. &#x201c;It is all one to him whether his cage is at sea or on land, he is still at home,&#x201d; said the captain, regarding his little favourite with an air of great affection, and evidently gratifi ed by the attention I bestowed on his bird.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have already formed a friendship with the little captive. He never fails to greet my approach with one of his sweetest songs, and will take from my fi ngers a bit of biscuit, which he holds in his claws till he has thanked me with a few of his clearest notes. This mark of acknowledg ment is termed by the steward, &#x201c;saying grace.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>If the wind still continues to favour us, the captain tells us we shall be on the banks of Newfoundland in another week.

Charles Brooks has written a thorough guide to nymph fishing. Illustrated with fine line drawings, superb photographs of water types, and four pages of flies in color.&#34;</p><p>Since nymph comprise more than 90 percent of a trout's normal diet, nymph imitations are potentially the most effective flies for trout - particularly large fish that rarely feed on the surface. Yet nymph fishing remains one of the most difficult and demanding forms of fly-fishing, often shrouded in mystery or half knowledge. Nymph Fishing For Larger Trout will take its place as one of the few real contributions to this important phase of angling. It is a down-to-earth, practical, and highly perceptive book for all fly-fishermen who want to improve their skills.Charles Brooks - already widely acclaimed for his practical, outspoken, and original books on angling - has written a thorough guide to nymph fishing. There are chapters on "The Problem of Identification' and the "Characteristic Nymphs, Larvae, and Crustaceans." After a helpful guide to the best tackle you will need, he presents in depth the Skues, Hewitt, Sawyer, Leisenring, upstream, Continuous Drift, Pot-Shooting, and other methods - and then his own, the Brooks method. He places special emphasis on catching those larger trout we all seek, and presents a full treatment of the most effective patterns.Graced by Dave Whitlock's fine line drawings, superb photographs of water types, and four pages of flies in color, Nymph Fishing For Larger Trout is sure to become one of the most important books in the fly-fisherman's library.

Elvis Presley has just completed filming "Kissin' Cousins," a hillbilly romantic comedy of which he is instantly ashamed. His romance with Ann-Margret has just become public knowledge and Priscilla is on the warpath.

As Miaow's carefully constructed personal life falls apart, Rafferty discovers that the murders are part of a conspiracy that reaches the top rungs of Bangkok law enforcement, and beyond.

Instead of its usual reddish brown, a gift of the topsoil it steals from the rice farmers upstream, it&#x2019;s a cold, metallic gray-green, the color of the sea beneath clouds. And it runs faster than it should, fast enough to whip up curving rills of white foam where the water quickens over the tops of stones.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the sky is a bottomless, unblemished blue, the girl can&#x2019;t find the sun. She sits on the green bank, shadowless, watching the river&#x2019;s flow, not knowing her name and not very bothered by it. Several names come to her, and they all seem to be hers, but she knows she only has one. If she could see her face, she thinks, if she knew how old she is, she&#x2019;d know which name to accept.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The landscape offers no clues or indications. There&#x2019;s nothing but the stunted forest with its ragged, disorderly trees and waist-high scrub, and the wide gray-green river, flowing swiftly toward her and then past her, leaving her here, a stationary dot on its passage to the sea.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pale distance away, the river bends to the right and disappears behind a faded green treeline. All that water rounding the bend, resolutely silent, unaware of her. But why shouldn&#x2019;t it be unaware of her? She&#x2019;s barely aware of herself. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experimentally, she examines her right hand, holding it just above the ground with its tangled green cover. Her hand is so sharp that it seems closer than it is, and she can see the faint blue map of veins beneath her skin pulse with each heartbeat. She feels the blood rushing through them, a tiny river within her, and that thought draws her eyes back to the larger river, and then upstream to the bend where it vanishes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she knows&#x2014;with no feeling of discovery, but as though she has <i>always</i> known&#x2014;that up there, out of sight, on the far side of the bend, the river is bringing something to her. Bearing it, whatever it is, on its unstoppable flow. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&#x2019;s something enormous.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thinks, &#x201c;I need to talk to my mother.&#x201d; And then the day dims and the girl shivers and realizes that she&#x2019;s grown suddenly cold.<br> &nbsp;<br> *<br><br> For the thousandth time since they began to live together, Rose wakes up shivering and asks herself why Poke puts the air-con on high every night, turning their bedroom into a refrigerator, and then steals every blanket on the bed so he can build a fort against the cold he has created.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother?</i> she thinks as a tiny scrap of her dream surfaces like a fragment of mosaic and then sinks again. <i>Why would my mother come to me? Or did she? Mostly, it seems, mostly, it was the river.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose never<i> </i>knowingly ignores a dream. Automatically, she checks the time, which is announced in the sleepy-blue numerals of the bedside clock as 2:46. Too late to call. If something is wrong, there&#x2019;s nothing she can do now. She&#x2019;ll call first thing in the morning, make Poke bring her the phone while his silly, fancy coffee is dripping and the water is heating for her Nescaf�.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still. The dream.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stretches her arms and her legs and then sits up and reaches for the pack of Marlboro Golds parked permanently on the table, just in front of her big glass ashtray, with this week&#x2019;s disposable lighter lying obediently on top of it. She knows the smoke will wake Poke, so she makes a silent deal with herself. She won&#x2019;t hold the lighter in place when she picks up the pack, and if the lighter falls off she&#x2019;ll put the pack back and go to sleep.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the pack is in front of her, the lighter is dead center on top.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She palms the lighter and flips open the top of the box, inhaling the rich brown aroma. Even in the dark, the precise white cylinders of the filters are comfortingly clean and&#x2014;<i>unused</i>. They promise hours of solitary pleasure. For so many years, the years when she was dancing in the bars on Patpong, being dragged night after night to hotels by sodden, besotted customers, the moment when it was finally over and she was once again alone&#x2014;free to breathe again, free to light up a cigarette that belonged to no one but her, to pay attention to no one&#x2019;s pleasure but her own&#x2014;had gleamed in front of her like a lantern seen through dark trees. It said, <i>Here you are. Here you can be safe again. Here you can be you again.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She flicks the lighter and looks down at the cigarette, so secure, so snug, so <i>right</i> between her long fingers. There&#x2019;s been one there for so long that she can barely feel it; in fact, sometimes when she lights one it&#x2019;s just because she&#x2019;s become aware of its absence. Smoking this one now is just a matter of inches: inches to put the filter between her lips, inches to bring the flame to the tip. But instead of putting it in her mouth, she thinks, <i>I need to talk to my mother</i>, and sees briefly and vividly the river in her dream, broad and gray-green. Breathes in the clean air of the forest.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lets the lighter go dark and puts the cigarette back in the pack, replaces both objects on the table. The cold darkness presses itself against her. She can feel Poke to her right, can feel, with a mother&#x2019;s ability to penetrate walls, Miaow breathing safely, asleep in her own room. She can feel the city outside pulling at her like a tide in her veins, its straight streets deceptively orderly, a reassuring grid imposed on chaos: need, fear, desire, envy, desolation, hopelessness, the invisible web woven by those on both sides of the karmic wheel, those who curse it and the fortunate ones who accept it as their due.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But up here, in the rooms the three of them share, everything is where it should be. Nothing rolls around. The lines between them are straight and strong. Sometimes when she&#x2019;s sitting in her spot on the couch in the living room, she imagines them, each lost in whatever he or she is doing but connected nonetheless by a pale, transparent yellow line, like concentrated light. She can walk through the line between Poke and Miaow and feel it go straight through her, warm as the sun.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poke</i>, she thinks. <i>Warm</i>, she thinks.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bends down and touches first her left foot and then her right, which may at the moment be the coldest foot in all of Southeast Asia. Poke has his back to her, knees drawn up, the human core of a mountain range of blankets. He sleeps naked, and it&#x2019;s easy, as she slips the foot beneath the blankets, to target the warm bare skin on the small of his back.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mountain erupts, blankets flying everywhere, and whatever he says, the English is too fast for her to follow it. He sits there wild-eyed, blankets pooled down around his hips, breathing like he&#x2019;s just run a mile, and before he can say anything else, she wraps both arms around his warm neck and pulls him down to her. Says, her mouth inches from his, &#x201c;Pay attention to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> *<br> &nbsp;<br> For what seems like the second time in an instant, Miaow sits up. The coolness of her forehead tells her she&#x2019;s been perspiring in spite of the single lightweight sheet that covers her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hears herself panting. Her heart sounds a quicker-than-normal rhythm in her ears, muffled as a drum in a distant room. But everything she&#x2019;s looking for right now is <i>here</i>, it&#x2019;s all here, after all: her dresser, her closet door framing the pale ghosts of her clothes, the rectangular blotches that represent her paintings and drawings. So even though the room is so dark she hates it, hates the paint she made Poke choose nine weeks ago, still, she <i>is</i> in her room, which means that she was only dreaming that she woke up before.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When her bed was on the sidewalk. Crowded, like most Bangkok sidewalks, dusk but not yet dark: bat-time, mosquito-time, evening crowd-time, people pushing their way around the bed without noticing what it was, without seeing her as she sat bolt upright with the sheet clutched to her chest. Trying to hide the dirty T-shirt, the ragged shorts, the blackened feet and scabby knees, the grimy nails, dark skin, snotty upper lip, and tangled hair of a street child.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They flowed around her like water around a stone, as though she were something of no value, not worth a glance. But <i>dirty</i>. A few women tugged at their skirts or moved their purses from one arm to another, as though they were afraid something might hop on them from the filthy child, lost in the bed in the middle of the sidewalk.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The filthy child.&nbsp; The impoverished, lice-ridden, terrified child she has tried so frantically to leave behind.&nbsp; The child no one at her fancy school knows she ever was.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miaow realizes she&#x2019;s clenching the bottom sheet in her hand, so hard her forearm is cramping. She releases the cloth, flexes her fingers, and picks up her pillow. She stands it on end in her lap and puts both arms around it, hugging it to her. It&#x2019;s not enough. She thinks about going into the other room to crawl in between Poke and Rose as they mumble permission they won&#x2019;t remember in the morning.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hasn&#x2019;t done that in <i>years</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she hasn&#x2019;t had this dream in years, either. It&#x2019;s been five years now since she was seven or eight and couldn&#x2019;t read and didn&#x2019;t know her full name, and they took her off the sidewalk and put her in this safe little box eight stories up. Wrapped a life around her, a life she hadn&#x2019;t even known how to imagine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why dream it now?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could talk about it tomorrow at school with Andrew, she thinks, except that Andrew doesn&#x2019;t know she was ever a street child, and anyway he&#x2019;s so <i>boy</i>. Dreams and feelings don&#x2019;t interest him. He lives in that strange boy world where the only things that matter are the things you can see in hard light, the things you can bump into and measure and argue about: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not yellow, it&#x2019;s green, and if it were yellow, it would be a statistical improbability.&#x201d; If you said, &#x201c;It <i>feels</i> green,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d snort. Her least favorite thing about Andrew is his snort.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has to learn to <i>manage</i> him, she thinks, the way Rose manages Poke. Rose has gotten Poke, well, maybe not to <i>accept</i> that everything she believes in is real, but at least to acknowledge that it&#x2019;s all in the room with them&#x2014;the wonderful Rose-cloud of feelings and hopes and memories and beliefs and dreams. The maybes, the what-ifs, the wouldn&#x2019;t-it-be-fines, the ghosts and the spirits of place. If Poke were to draw a map of their apartment, he&#x2019;d probably find a way to put it in.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Rose would tell him he got the color wrong.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same way <i>she</i> did, Miaow did, in this room. Picked a color so dark she can barely see her own feet.&nbsp; So here she is, wide awake in a room that&#x2019;s way too dark, and they&#x2019;re in there, sound asleep. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But still, there are walls around them, keeping out everything that&#x2019;s not-them. In a few hours it&#x2019;ll be light and they&#x2019;ll all say hello to one another again and pass one another in the rooms and the hallway, surrounded by the smell of Poke&#x2019;s stupid coffee, and&#x2014;and&#x2014;they&#x2019;ll <i>fuel up</i> from one another before they go out into the day. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hugs the pillow closer. Everything is fine. She&#x2019;s here to stay. <i>They&#x2019;re</i> here to stay. She&#x2019;s got school, she&#x2019;s got a few friends, she&#x2019;s got Andrew, such as he is. The filthy child has been left far, far behind. Everything is fine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why did she have that dream again? Without thinking, she glances at the clock. It&#x2019;s 2:51 AM.</p><h2>How Race Survived US History: From Settlement and Slavery to the Obama Phenomenon</h2><p>In this absorbing chronicle of the role of race in US history, David R. Roediger explores how the idea of race was created and recreated from the 1600&#x2019;s to the present day. From the late seventeenth century&#x2014;the era in which DuBois located the emergence of &#x201c;whiteness&#x201d;&#x2014;through the American revolution and the emancipatory Civil War, to the civil rights movement and the emergence of the American empire, <i>How Race Survived US History</i> reveals how race did far more than persist as an exception in a progressive national history. Roediger examines how race intersected all that was dynamic and progressive in US history, from democracy and economic development to migration and globalization.<br><br>Exploring the evidence that the USA will become a majority &#x201c;non-white&#x201d; nation in the next fifty years, this masterful account shows how race remains at the heart of American life in the twenty-first century.</p><p><b>David Roediger</b> is Kendrick Babcock Chair of History at the University of Illinois.

This inversion, always dressed in self-righteous indignation, is actually part of the social evolution of white supremacy. David Roediger&#x2019;s book details in sharp and readable prose how race survived US history. It is a must-read for all who strive to understand&#x2014;and abolish&#x2014;what underlies the strangely strident rhetoric enveloping everything from presidential contests to prison expansion.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Ruth Wilson Gilmore</b><br><br> &#x201c;In a trenchant, broad-ranging analysis, the leading US historian of racism, David Roediger, demonstrates white supremacy&#x2019;s incredible staying power against major societal forces that should long ago have dismantled it.

He was for twenty years professor of English and director of writing programs at the University of California, Irvine, and in 1998 received a PEN Center USA West Award of Honor for lifetime literary achievement.The suffrage cause, embodied by three pretty suffragists (the "trey of pearls" of the title), provides the background for Hall's fourth literate historical (after 2003's Ambrose Bierce and the One-Eyed Jacks), set in San Francisco in 1892. Curmudgeonly journalist Ambrose Bierce and his young sidekick, Tom Redmond, look into the shooting death of popular preacher and notorious ladies' man Henry Devine. A second murder follows, of banker William P. Jaspers, whose wife was a devotee of the Reverend Devine. In between interviewing jealous husbands and trying to locate possibly vengeful offspring, Tom pursues his free-love-advocating cousin Amanda Wilson with mixed success, while Bierce exchanges barbs with novelist Gertrude Atherton and otherwise comments cynically on the proceedings. During one interlude, the author of The Devil's Dictionary cites approvingly examples of Ulysses S. Grant's direct and vigorous prose. Hall's spare, laconic style is of comparable quality. Despite a contrived denouement that allows Redmond to perform some stagy heroics during a suffragist parade and a remote killer who remains little more than a set of motivations, Hall delivers an ingenious twist at the end, with subtle hints along the way, that should catch most readers by surprise.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the streets and at the thoroughfares, in the market places and on its public buildings and monuments, and especially on its coins the Roman Empire's imperial iconographers displayed imagery that aimed to persuade the Empire's diverse and mostly illiterate inhabitants that Rome had a divinely appointed right to rule the world and to be honoured and celebrated for its dominion. </p><p>Harry O. Maier places the later, often contested, letters and theology associated with Paul in the social and political context of the Roman Empire's visual culture of politics and persuasion to show how followers of the apostle visualized the reign of Christ in ways consistent with central themes of imperial iconography. They drew on the Empire's picture language to celebrate the dominion and victory of the divine Son, Jesus, to persuade their audiences to honour his dominion with praise and thanksgiving. </p><p>Key to this imperial embrace were Colossians, Ephesians, and the Pastoral Epistles. Yet these letters remain neglected territory in consideration of engagement with and reflection of imperial political ideals and goals amongst Paul and his followers.

From page one and nonstop, Christopher Cook, a brilliant new talent in crime fiction, takes two drifters on a wild and bloody ride across the state of Texas. Written with an eye and heart for the rural south so true that readers will smell the magnolia and taste the dust, this first novel has such authenticity, assuredness, and strength that it will be immediately apparent why James Ellroy has already described it as &#34;my kind of book.&#34; From its terse opening lines Robbers promises to be any crime and mystery fan&#39;s kind of book: &#34;Eddie didn&#39;t intend to shoot the guy. Didn&#39;t intend to rob him, either. What happened was - &#34; Thus begins the path of mayhem laid by the two drifters Eddie and Ray Bob, one a sociopath and the other a talented blues guitarist, as well as the mission of the Texas Ranger who pursues them. As the two losers wind their way across Texas, robbing and killing with no long-range plans, and no immediate ones either, they hook up with a young woman named Della. Eddie falls in love with her and decides to clean up his act for her - much to the disgust of Ray Bob, who preferred the trigger-happy life with his buddy before the intrusion of Della with her middle-class desire for respectability.</p><p>Start with a clich�: Texas is big. Big enough for someone to start running and keep running, big enough to harbor dreams, big enough to crush them. Then transmute the clich� into narrative gold, spun from violence, bittersweet humor, beauty, and terror. The alchemist is Christopher Cook, whose first novel is a noir powerhouse: uncompromising and authentic, with darkly funny characters and prose that veers magically between grandeur and grit. Think James Lee Burke and Elmore Leonard, but think William Faulkner and Cormac McCarthy too.<p> The bleak joyride of <i>Robbers</i> follows Eddie and Ray Bob, drifters bound together against a common enemy they're powerless to define (boredom, conventionality, poverty?), on a killing spree across the Lone Star state. A chance shooting in a convenience store sets the two runnin' buddies on a road noteworthy for its anonymity as well as its violence: </p><blockquote>The twin tunnels of light the Caddy bored forward into darkness never faltered but seemed to gain no ground different from any other. The FM still didn't work, and they changed from one AM station to another as they ran out from beneath the reach of each into broken waves of static. That's how they knew they were moving. Otherwise they might not have known in that broad charcoal sweep beneath wheeling constellations.</blockquote> One shooting leads inexorably to another, and another... though nothing else is sure in this breathtaking novel, which counters anticipation with surprise at every turn. The novel's brutality is matter-of-fact, but never casual. When Della, a single mother with an unusually pressing problem, joins Eddie and Ray Bob on the run, the picture gets complicated for all concerned. And the drift becomes a pursuit rich with near-mythic overtones, as Texas Ranger Rule Hooks tracks the trio from the Gulf Coast to the pine forests of East Texas. Hooks is a pragmatic loner with an uncanny ability to sense the movements of his prey: "He stood still. He was having a feeling. He had them now and then and sometimes he listened and sometimes he didn't. It all depended. Just now he didn't know. Wasn't sure." <p> It may be bad luck to speak of the expectations for Cook's next novel, but when one's debut is as astonishing as this, high expectations are inevitable, as is the impatience with which readers, bowled over by <i>Robbers</i>' speed and skill, will await the next serendipitous event. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Christopher Cook is the author of many short stories and two award-winning fiction books, "Robbers" and "Screen Door Jesus &amp; Other Stories", also available in Kindle editions.

Today Adam Smith&#39;s reputation rests on his explanation of how rational self-interest in a free-market economy leads to economic well-being. It may surprise those who would discount Smith as an advocate of ruthless individualism that his first major work concentrates on ethics and charity. In fact, while chair at the University of Glasgow, Smith&#39;s lecture subjects, in order of preference, were natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence, and economics, according to John Millar, Smith&#39;s pupil at the time. In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith wrote: &#34;How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature which interest him in the fortune of others and render their happiness necessary to him though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.&#34; The Theory of Moral Sentiments establishes the intellectual framework for all of Smith&#39;s later work, including the monumental Wealth of Nations.</p><p>Adam Smith&#39;s Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) lays the foundation for a general system of morals, and is a text of central importance in the history of moral and political thought. By means of the idea of sympathy and the mental construct of an impartial spectator, Smith formulated highly original theories of conscience, moral judgment and the virtues. This volume offers a new edition of the text with helpful notes for the student reader, together with a substantial introduction that sets the work in its philosophical and historical context.&#34;In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith assigned himself a difficult and dangerous task: to establish for educated men in an increasingly revolutionary age the reasonableness of morality and the necessity of the fruits of virtue - illustrated by the wisdom of the classical authors of antiquity. This book, Adam Smith&#39;s first, is, then, proof to skeptics of the importance of morality; and an antidote to those who think that free-market economics can be divorced from a moral society.&#34;--BOOK JACKET.</p><h2>Hotel Bolivia: The Culture of Memory in a Refuge from Nazism</h2><p>In the 1930s, thousands of people fleeing Nazi-dominated Europe found refuge in Latin America. But by late 1938, Bolivia was one of the few places in the entire world that was still accepting Jewish refugees; more than twenty thousand Central Europeans soon remade their lives there. Leo Spitzer examines, with exemplary subtlety and detail, the tension between memory and history that shows in their story: their European culture, their Jewish identities, their sense of displacement, and their experience of Bolivia's politics and society.<br></p><p>When, in the mid-1930s, Jews began to leave Europe in flight from Nazi persecution, they found that they were welcome only in a few countries. One of them was Bolivia, which, despite the presence of many pro-Nazi German �migr�s, readily accepted 20,000 Jewish refugees. Thousands of miles away from the unfolding Holocaust, these newcomers struggled to rebuild their lives--to find work, to begin families, to make a home among strangers. And they struggled to retain the memory of their now destroyed homelands, to preserve their customs and languages in the shock of displacement. Leo Spitzer, born in La Paz to Austrian Jewish refugees, offers an ethnographic historical account of the world of the Bolivian Jews, an account made richer by his explorations of his family's past. At the heart of his study is a troubling question: should not all the Jews of Europe, well aware of Hitler's intentions, have left their homes and come to places like Bolivia? His consideration of why so many stayed to face death lends philosophical weight to what is already a valuable contribution to Holocaust studies--even if Spitzer modestly closes by suggesting that the story of the Bolivian Jews may well "shrink to a paragraph, a sentence, even to a footnote within the larger story of Nazi persecution." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><b>Leo spitze</b>r was born in La Paz in 1939.

As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company&#x2019;s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO.

What begins as the captivating story of one woman&#x2019;s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge.</p><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2013:</strong> As a fiction writer, indie publishing icon and education activist Dave Eggers neither suffers fools gladly nor treads lightly. With his signature mix of intelligence and highly literate snark, he dives headlong into contemporary crises--Hurricane Katrina, the Sudanese civil war--through the lens of a single character whose perspective we get to know intimately. In his new novel, Eggers tackles a modern problem that doesn't always seem like one: our near constant hunger for communication. When Mae Holland takes a job at the Circle, a tech giant with a utopian culture and cultlike following (Eggers didn't call it Schmoogle, but may as well have), she quickly loses sight of her friends, family, and sense of self in favor of professional success and social acceptance. As her Circle star rises, Mae succumbs to the corporate code of full disclosure, eventually agreeing to "go transparent" and let the public watch--and comment on--her every move. "Privacy is theft," decrees the company motto; "Secrets are lies." It's not subtle, but neither were "Harrison Bergeron" and <em>1984</em>, and in its best moments <em>The Circle</em> is equally terrifying. Let's just hope it's not prescient. --<em>Mia Lipman</em>Dave Eggers grew up near Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is the founder of McSweeney&#x2019;s, an independent publishing house in San Francisco that produces books, a quarterly journal of new writing (<i>McSweeney&#x2019;s Quarterly Concern</i>), and a monthly magazine, <i>The Believer</i>. McSweeney&#x2019;s publishes Voice of Witness, a nonprofit book series that uses oral history to illuminate human rights crises around the world. In 2002, he cofounded 826 Valencia, a nonprofit youth writing and tutoring center in San Francisco&#x2019;s Mission District.

TONY BENN</p>Robert Tressell was the pseudonym of Robert Noonan, an Irish housepainter, who came to England from South Africa at the turn of the century. With his daughter Kathleen and his sister Adelaide, he settled in Hastings, where he worked as a signwriter for various building firms. Tressell played a large part in local politics, joining the Social Democratic Federation (one of the forerunners of the Labour Party), and was often to be seen preaching the word from a soapbox on Hastings beach. His experience of English working life and his subsequent political awakening were to provide the material for <i>The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</i>, his one and only novel. Tressell intended the book to be a 'socialist documentary' based on real people and real events, a work which he hoped would convert his fellow workers to the creed. However, Tressell never lived to see his book in print: his manuscript was rejected by several publishers and, dispirited and disillusioned, he decided to emigrate to Canada in 1910. Unfortunately, Tressell was taken ill en route in Liverpool and died from TB the following year, aged forty. <i>The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</i> was published three years later.</p><h2>Attitude Is Everything: 10 Life-Changing Steps to Turning Attitude into Action</h2><p><p>In the world of motivational speakers, Keith Harrell is a star. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> recognized it--dubbing him "A Star with Attitude."

"It's how well, and how consistently, you put that knowledge to use." In <i>Attitude Is Everything</i>, Harrell teaches 10 steps for "an attitude tune-up" that "turns attitude into action." Some of these steps are identifying the attitudes that hold you back or propel you forward, reframing bad attitudes, building supportive relationships, and seeing change as opportunity. Harrell weaves his personal stories into the book, such as turning the disappointment of not being drafted by the NBA after college (which he had fully expected) into skillfully landing a job with IBM, even though he didn't have the qualifications and they weren't hiring at that time. In each section, he discusses an attitude concept, illustrates it with anecdotes, and teaches specific strategies for integrating it into your life--all in an easygoing, friendly, and motivating style. For example, the "Your Attitude Tool Kit" chapter opens with Harrell being notified in junior high school that he had to go to speech therapy for his stuttering, as he had for six years, and using affirmations to cure his stuttering on the spot. Then he teaches nine "Attitude Tools," explaining each one and showing you how to put it into action. <i>--Joan Price</i>Keith Harrell was one of IBM&#39;s top training instructors, with more than thirteen years of corporate experience.

He needed time to reflect and pray and nourish his spiritual life and time away from those bonehead disciples. He needed space. And, Jesus had a lot to do. You try being the Savior of the world! He had a short window to accomplish his life mission and yet he seemed to prioritize and live so different than we do. To say &#39;no&#39; in ministry is to be radical...to be radical is to be counter-cultural...to be counter-cultural is to be like Jesus...to be like Jesus should become our goal.</p><p>Doug Fields has been a leader in youth ministry for over 30 years.

While the primary purpose of this book is to disseminated better understanding of the vast ramifications of functional furniture ideas that contemporary design makes available for the enhancement of modern homes it goes on to illustrate with original artwork, line drawings and hundreds of photographs, how the homemaker may actually apply these new sources of contemporary expression. For as well as exposing the origins and significant characteristics of the contemporary style, [this book] also addresses the subject in a practical manner. Starting with the second chapter, it presents a variety of elementary furniture projects, together with how-to construction drawings which can be easily followed even by individuals of limited craft skill. Easy ways are shown to assemble complete projects from the standard parts and fittings that can be bought at hardware and department stores, and there are many plans for woodworking craftsmen, including the author&#39;s original designs of contemporary rooms and a chapter on &#39;contemporary classics&#39; complete with measured drawings showing how these superb functional pieces are actually made by leading manufacturers of contemporary furniture. Page after page of easy step-by-step photo sequences give graphic and detailed information on exactly how contemporary objects are built, assembled, installed, arranged, and finished. Simplified methods of do-it-yourself upholstering are shown, and a completely illustrated chapter on furniture finishing demonstrates the proper application of rich Danish oils and other modern techniques.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It</h2><p><b>Based on Nixon&#x2019;s overlooked recordings, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author John W. Dean connects the dots between what we&#x2019;ve come to believe about Watergate and what actually happened</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Watergate forever changed American politics, and in light of the revelations about the NSA&#x2019;s widespread surveillance program, the scandal has taken on new significance. Yet remarkably, four decades after Nixon was forced to resign, no one has told the full story of his involvement in Watergate.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>The Nixon Defense</i>, former White House Counsel John W. Dean, one of the last major surviving figures of Watergate, draws on his own transcripts of almost a thousand conversations, a wealth of Nixon&#x2019;s secretly recorded information, and more than 150,000 pages of documents in the National Archives and the Nixon Library to provide the definitive answer to the question: What did President<br>Nixon know and when did he know it?<br>&nbsp;<br>Through narrative and contemporaneous dialogue, Dean connects dots that have never been connected, including revealing how and why the Watergate break-in occurred, what was on the mysterious 18 1/2 minute gap in Nixon&#x2019;s recorded conversations, and more.<br>&nbsp;<br>In what will stand as the most authoritative account of one of America&#x2019;s worst political scandals, <i>The Nixon Defense</i> shows how the disastrous mistakes of Watergate could have been avoided and offers a cautionary tale for our own time.</p><p><b>John W. Dean</b> was legal counsel to president Nixon during the Watergate scandal, and his Senate testimony helped lead to Nixon&#x2019;s resignation. In 2006, he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee investigating George W. Bush&#x2019;s NSA warrantless wiretap program. He is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Blind Ambition</i>, <i>Broken Government</i>, <i>Conservatives Without Conscience</i>, and <i>Worse Than Watergate</i>.<p></p><p></p><p>Preface</p><p>The report of the arrests in the early morning hours of June 17, 1972, of five men who had broken into the Watergate complex offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), wearing business suits and surgical gloves, their pockets stuffed with hundred-dollar bills, was something like a scene from a circa 1940s low-budget black-and-white gangsters B movie. This caught-in-the-act stupidity seemed too dumb to be ours, since the undertaking was so conspicuously illegal and inexplicably risky, not to mention obviously bungled. But this political surveillance debacle <i>did</i> turn out to be ours, the work of a ham-fisted team of amateurs assembled by G. Gordon Liddy, a former Nixon White House staff member who was then serving as general counsel of the finance operation of the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP). This was, in fact, the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency. It was the start of Watergate, a story that has been told and retold, but never as I am going to tell it in the pages that follow.</p><p>The central character in Watergate was, of course, the president of the United States, Richard Nixon. From beginning to end Nixon sought to defend himself and his presidency from the political and legal consequences that followed the arrests at the DNC on June 17, 1972. This is the story of Nixon&#x2019;s defense, the story I found when trying to understand how someone as politically savvy and intelligent as Richard Nixon, a man who surrounded himself with those he thought the best and brightest, allowed this &#x201c;third-rate,&#x201d; bungled burglary to destroy his presidency. The story of the Nixon defense is Richard Nixon&#x2019;s Watergate story.</p><p>Most of Nixon&#x2019;s Watergate-related activities were secretly self-recorded. These surreptitious recordings eventually revealed that his public Watergate defenses were colossal deceptions, patent lies that eventually forced his resignation. Nixon&#x2019;s secret recordings provided much of the overwhelming evidence that sent his former top advisers to prison, not to mention forced his own early retirement. So some of this story has been around for several decades. Investigators and prosecutors, however, were not interested in the context and circumstances of Nixon&#x2019;s ill-conceived defensive efforts; rather, they focused only on select portions of conversations that could provide evidence establishing wrongdoing beyond a reasonable doubt, so as to end any malfeasance and punish malefactors. Historians, in recounting the Watergate story, have relied largely and almost exclusively on the information gathered by the Watergate investigators and prosecutors. Remarkably, historians and other students of the Nixon presidency have chosen to ignore the full collection of secretly recorded White House conversations relating to Watergate, which slowly but surely have become almost fully available over the past four decades.</p><p>Before now, no one has attempted to catalog and transcribe all of Nixon&#x2019;s Watergate conversations, and to examine and reconstruct this history based on this primary source material, the likes of which has never before existed. The account in the pages that follow is based on this unique collection, and it is presented not as transcripts but rather as narrative and dialogue drawn from and based on them. The story that follows is a first-person account of what I found in this unique historical record. In telling this story I have only edited the transcripts to make them readable and understandable, correcting the obvious anomalies that inevitably occur in spontaneous conversations and often compressing material to report its essence.1 Almost all the conversations from which this account is drawn are available online at the Nixon Presidential Library&#x2019;s Web site: http://nixon.archives.gov/virtuallibrary/tapeexcerpts/index.php; the exceptions are those from June 1972, which are available at the Miller Center, which is devoted to presidential scholarship at the University of Virginia: http://web2.millercenter.org/rmn/audiovisual/whrecordings/ (see chron1).</p><p>The Nixon defense&#x2014;both legal and political, because they were inseparable&#x2014;was assembled behind closed doors in a process that began in the days following the arrests at the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic Party. The first public statement of a defense was made by Nixon on June 22, 1972&#x2014;that nobody in his White House was involved in this bizarre incident&#x2014;and Nixon&#x2019;s final firewall explanation of his defense was issued eleven months later, on May 22, 1973; the latter followed the firing of his top aides, including your author, who had become the centerpiece of his defense. Because I was deeply involved in and later the focus of the Nixon defense, I always hoped someone else would tell this story. I also understood such an undertaking meant the not easily accomplished task of transcribing all of Richard Nixon&#x2019;s Watergate conversations. Of course, we knew the broad outlines of his activities that led to his resignation, and he did provide some additional details in his memoir. But he, too, relied primarily on conversations that had been transcribed by investigators and prosecutors, leaving most of the historical facts buried in his secretly recorded conversations. Having now transcribed all those conversations, and grasping the content of the newly transcribed material, I understand why he wanted no more information than was already easily available made public, for while this additional information explains many of the activities he was responsible for, those rationales do not redound to Richard Nixon&#x2019;s glory.</p><p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which Congress charged with the preservation of this historical Nixon material, has prepared, and continues to update and refine as it has released more of the Nixon recordings, a detailed &#x201c;subject log&#x201d; highlighting all the content of all the recorded conversations. This can be used to identify topics and the persons addressed, along with times and dates. No one has ever bothered to identify all the Watergate conversations that can be located with these subject logs. Today that can be done digitally. When I did it in 2009, I had to do it manually, which took several months, although given the volume of material, even today it would take almost as long. Depending on how you count them&#x2014;as it is not always clear when one conversation ends and another begins&#x2014;there are approximately one thousand Watergate-related conversations. Some of them run only minutes while others run many hours.</p><p>After &#x201c;my&#x201d; assembling a list, I first determined which of the conversations had previously been transcribed. Virtually all existing transcripts had been prepared from the analog recordings first made available by NARA. However, it is now possible to digitize these recordings, and when that technology became available, NARA began releasing digital editions. When I started this project in 2009, I was way ahead of the NARA release schedule for the Watergate-related material, so I decided to digitize that material before NARA had done so. Because the sound on these is improved, making it easier to understand and transcribe the conversations, my project became somewhat less challenging. But today, the best copies of the recordings are found at NARA, for they prepared copies from the best editions of the analog tapes and have used the latest technology.</p><p>For example, the Watergate Special Prosecution Force (WSPF) transcribed all or parts of eighty Watergate-related conversations. When I checked the quality of the transcripts using the digital recordings, I found it was sometimes possible to hear material that those who prepared the WSPF transcripts had been unable to. Also, I found that those used in the cover-up trial, <i>U.S. v. Mitchell et al.</i>, were of better quality than those not used in the trial. Clearly the Watergate defendants had taken the time to listen to them carefully, and to make corrections, so those used at trial are more reliable than the drafts prepared by FBI secretaries; often the secretary was not sure who was speaking, so some were identified incorrectly, along with other such conspicuous errors.</p><p>Former University of Wisconsin historian Stanley Kutler, working with Alan Morrison&#x2019;s Public Citizen Litigation Group, successfully sued NARA to make public Nixon&#x2019;s so-called abuses of government power recordings long before the former president wanted them released, and these covered Watergate as well as earlier abuses of power. Professor Kutler published partial transcripts of 320 Watergate-related conversations from the first release by NARA in 1996, along with portions of hundreds of other unrelated ones, in <i>Abuse of Power: The New Nixon Tapes</i> (New York: Free Press, 1997). These, however, were all based on analog recordings. When I began using modern digital listening equipment for the audio of randomly selected conversations transcribed by Professor Kutler&#x2019;s team, I discovered I could hear things they had missed. I further found that information I thought important had not, for one reason or another, been included in the transcripts he published. Professor Kutler selected portions of conversations he felt relevant and interesting, and understandably he did not include Nixon&#x2019;s almost obsessive-compulsive repetition of information related to Watergate; he had to trim many conversations, because there was simply too much material for one book, and he excluded most conversations previously transcribed by others. While I also had to trim material for this book, I focused on abuses that fall within the term &#x201c;Watergate&#x201d; (as it was later defined by Congress to mean both the break-in and the cover-up), and I did so only after having examined the entire available conversation.</p><p>In addition, in private conversations with his staff Nixon had a highly repetitive nature&#x2014;and only those who may someday go through all these conversations will ever fully appreciate that my describing it as &#x201c;obsessive-compulsive&#x201d; is an understatement&#x2014;that created something of an editorial problem. I did not want the repetition to become tedious for the reader, yet while drastically digesting and compressing these conversations as I have, it is also my hope to give the reader a feel for Nixon&#x2019;s behavior, and clearly he was obsessive about Watergate.* And as Nixon obsessed over Watergate, particularly starting in April 1973, as well as later, he was constantly reinventing what happened, and this is vital to understanding the story. Accordingly, I have tried to trim as tightly as possible without removing this very Nixonian character trait in his dealings with Watergate.</p><p>Available transcripts also include those transcribed by the Nixon White House and turned over to the House Judiciary Committee&#x2019;s impeachment inquiry: forty-seven conversations (a collection running thirteen hundred pages) on April 30, 1974, that were published in a document known as the <i>Submission of Recorded Presidential Conversations to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives</i> (SRPC). Because of the poor quality of the transcripts prepared by the White House, not to mention selective edits and omissions, many of these were retranscribed by the committee. When working on his memoir, Richard Nixon had one of his longtime secretaries, Mrs. Marjorie Acker, prepare transcripts of all his Watergate-related conversations with aides, chief of staff Bob Haldeman, assistant to the president for domestic affairs John Ehrlichman and special counsel to the president Charles Colson for the first month following his return to the White House after the arrests at the Watergate; that is, from June 20 through July 20, 1972. He included as well transcripts of his conversations with Haldeman in May 1973, but only when they were reconstructing what they remembered about the events of June 23, 1972&#x2014;the date of the so-called smoking-gun discussion, when Nixon authorized Haldeman to meet with the CIA &#x201c;to limit the FBI&#x2019;s investigation of Watergate.&#x201d;2 Neither Nixon nor his estate has ever made his completed transcripts publicly available, although the material he drew from them is presented in the narrative of his memoir, which I have checked and noted as this book unfolds. By my count, Marjorie Acker transcribed, at most, about forty Watergate-related conversations, based on Nixon&#x2019;s description of her work.</p><p>In summary, I found (roughly) 447 Watergate conversations had been transcribed. Most were only partials, but a few were of complete conversations, plus the material used in Nixon&#x2019;s memoir. (More specifically, I found 80 Watergate conversations transcribed by WSPF; 47 by the White House, including those retranscribed by the House Judiciary Committee; and 320 by Stanley Kutler.) Based on my list of all Watergate conversations, this meant that 634 conversations had never been transcribed by anyone, nor likely even listened to by anyone outside the NARA staff involved in processing them for public release (i.e., removing information that is classified for national security or designated personal/private, such as most of the conversations between the president and his wife or daughters).</p><p>Because all these transcripts were prepared from analog recordings, and most are only partials, I realized I needed to start from scratch and prepare ones of all the conversations to really be sure I understood what had occurred. There are good reasons no one had done this. Not only was it not easy to obtain digital copies of it all, but even with them, it is challenging work.</p><p>Most of the audio from telephone conversations is of relatively good quality compared with that obtained in other locations. Telephones in the Oval Office, the Executive Office Building (EOB) and the Lincoln Sitting Room in the residence and the telephones in the president&#x2019;s study in Aspen Lodge at Camp David created near-broadcast-quality recorded telephone calls. In the Oval Office, if the speakers were seated not too far from the president&#x2019;s desk, where the microphones were embedded, conversations are discernible with patience. Recordings made in the president&#x2019;s study at Camp David are similar to those from the Oval Office. But those from the EOB office are consistently challenging, when not totally impossible, because of where people typically sat: They were usually out of the range of the microphones. Similarly with the Cabinet Room: It is possible usually to pick up only the gist of the president&#x2019;s remarks, while others almost never can be understood.</p><p>Because of the poor sound quality, transcribing Nixon&#x2019;s recordings is extremely arduous and time consuming, sometimes not even possible. It can take many hours to transcribe less than a minute of conversation from the poor-quality recordings in the president&#x2019;s EOB office; sometimes these efforts are especially essential, as particularly important discussions were often held there. Most people who have transcribed these tapes discover that listening over and over and over enabled them to better understand what is being said, as does listening on different audio equipment, with different digital software, and at different speeds&#x2014;and I occasionally employed all these techniques to the same conversation to tease out important information.</p><p>I fou...</p></p><h2>Finding Hope in the Last Words of Jesus</h2><p>Jesus was known for his attention-commanding teachings, but his dying words were extraordinary.

Married to Gordon Snell, she lived in Dalkey, Ireland, until her death in July 2012.&#34;The Bargain<br> &nbsp;<br> When Cara met Jim at a party the rest of the world seemed to dis�appear; they stood looking at each other with delight and listening to each other in fascination, as if they were old friends.<br> When the evening was over, they knew they would meet again and everyone else knew as well.<br> So they met the following day for lunch, and that turned into a walk beside the canal, and they spent so long over a cup of coffee that the waitress had to ask them to order another one or leave.<br> They were both aged twenty-eight, they loved travel and jazz and cooking and dogs.<br> His mother had died three years ago. Her father had died at the same time.<br> Jim knew the fellow who was giving the party because he had been on the same hurling team as him, way back when they were kids.<br> Cara knew him because he was a driving instructor and he had helped her to get her test.<br> Cara was a short story writer. She had gone to the party to cel�ebrate having finished her latest collection of stories.<br> Jim sold agricultural machinery. He had come to Dublin to celebrate a big sale and his father making him a partner in the business. <br> Finally, they hit one problem.<br> Cara lived in Dublin. Jim lived two hundred miles away in the country.<br> He was going back home the following morning. So they talked nearly all night about what they would do and finally, exhausted, they agreed that Cara would make the journey to Jim&#x2019;s part of the world the next weekend.<br> They made a bargain.<br> If Cara hated it she was to say so. If she thought that she could manage to write her stories there, and that she wouldn&#x2019;t miss her Dublin life too much, then she would say that and they would get married as soon as possible.<br> That&#x2019;s how sure they were in less than forty-eight hours.<br> So they both waited nervously for Cara&#x2019;s visit.<br> It involved a train journey, followed by a bus trip. Jim was standing there waiting at the bus stop. Cara&#x2019;s heart leaped when she saw him look anxiously at the bus in case she might not be on board. She saw the smile light up his face. He was so generous and warm.<br> <i>Please </i>may this not be a desperate place, she prayed silently.<br> Jim couldn&#x2019;t leave his father and the business they had both built up. She knew that. And she would be the one who should move. She lived at home with her mother and a big family of broth�ers and sisters. Her younger sister would get Cara&#x2019;s bedroom. Life would go on without her. But Jim could not possibly leave home. His father and his four sisters depended on him to keep the busi�ness going.<br> Surely it couldn&#x2019;t be too bad a place? It had produced Jim, after all. But the countryside looked very wild and woolly as the bus had hurtled along. Frightening-looking goats, or sheep maybe, but probably goats. They had terrifying curvy horns. Small, rough fields divided by stone walls . . . It was very far from anywhere, anywhere normal. But she nailed a smile on her face and he held her in his arms for a long time.<br> &#x201c;I was afraid you might not come,&#x201d; he said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> They drove together down one of the four streets in the town and out into the countryside.<br> The house where Jim lived had old roses in the garden and sweet peas, and the grass had been freshly cut.<br> &#x201c;I did that this morning,&#x201d; Jim said. &#x201c;I was too excited to do anything else. They wouldn&#x2019;t let me near work in case I gave the machinery away.&#x201d;<br> His father was stooped over a stick, standing at the door to welcome them.<br> &#x201c;He told me that you were a lovely girl, Cara, and he didn&#x2019;t exaggerate,&#x201d; he said with a big, broad smile just like his son&#x2019;s.<br> Jim&#x2019;s sisters were in the kitchen, trying not to look too eager to examine her. The eldest one was Rose. The bossy one, Jim had said. She was married to a rich man about twenty miles away. A miserly man, Jim had said, who didn&#x2019;t like Rose wasting his earnings on things like hairdos and clothes. She was very forthright, he said, sometimes too forthright. Rose looked Cara up and down.<br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t often have visitors,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;ve prepared a room for you. It will be separate rooms, I&#x2019;m afraid. This is my father&#x2019;s house and we have standards.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to hear it,&#x201d; Cara replied with spirit. &#x201c;It would have been extremely embarrassing if it had been otherwise. Jim and I don&#x2019;t know each other very well yet, and certainly not well enough to share a room.&#x201d;<br> The other girls giggled. And even Rose looked at her with some respect.<br> Cara had won that round.<br> Jim had said that he would build a house nearer to the town. He had the land already and she would help him choose what kind of house. They would have a big studio where Cara would write, a small office where Jim would do his accounts, and plenty of rooms for when the children came along. <br> Together they would plant herbs and vegetables and flowers.<br> She looked around the table as they sat down for a late lunch; a lunch in her honor, with a full turnout to inspect and welcome her. Would these be her closest friends and contacts from now on if she were to make this giant leap and live here?<br> Could she bear trying to keep Rose in her place and to encourage the awkward, shyer younger ones, who seemed hesitant of themselves and doubting that they had anything to say unless it was drawn out of them?<br> Would she become involved in the machinery that Jim and his father were buying and selling?<br> Would she find anything to write about in this empty landscape and the small town with the four streets, one church, seventeen shops, and five public houses?<br> It would be ridiculous to make a decision on the basis of one weekend.<br> And anyway, Jim would have to come and meet <i>her </i>family and get to know them too. They didn&#x2019;t need to rush things, did they?<br> Then she looked across the table at him, his face beaming with pride that she was there, and she knew that there was no point in hanging about. This really <i>was </i>the kind of man she had dreamed of and never met. What did it matter where they lived, really?<br> They would not let Cara help with the washing up. Cara noticed that Rose filled a container with leftover food. &#x201c;Waste not, want not,&#x201d; she said when she saw she was being observed.<br> &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re so right. Very sensible,&#x201d; Cara said hastily.<br> The younger girls took her on a tour to show her everything: the hens and geese, the old donkey, the orchard and the cow in the far field.<br> They loved this place where they had grown up.<br> They also loved their big brother.<br> &#x201c;He never brought anyone home before,&#x201d; said one.<br> &#x201c;So we knew you were special,&#x201d; said another. <br> &#x201c;He talked about you all week,&#x201d; said the third.<br> Then Jim came and drove her into town. They walked around and he saluted almost everyone he met.<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have a drink,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;Which is your local?&#x201d; Cara asked.<br> &#x201c;In a place like this, with a job like mine, they&#x2019;re <i>all </i>my local,&#x201d; Jim said and he brought her into Ryan&#x2019;s.<br> He had obviously told everyone in the place about her. Cara realized that they were all expecting to meet her. She shook hands with a dozen people who all said to Jim that he had done well for himself up in Dublin. Amazing in the fumes of traffic and all the noise that he had managed to find such a lovely girl.<br> Then they went to Walsh&#x2019;s pub and the other three.<br> In every place they had heard she was coming and Cara began to get edgy, as if she was some kind of traveling exhibition instead of a girl down from Dublin for the weekend.<br> Jim had a lemonade in each place and so did Cara. She felt full of fizz and bubbles. Only the caf� and the garage to call on and then they could go home.<br> &#x201c;They all think you&#x2019;re wonderful,&#x201d; Jim said, &#x201c;and so do I.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She felt trapped and imprisoned by this marvelous man. She felt that it was all happening too quickly.<br> In a moment he would introduce her to the priest and they would set a day and then she would spend the rest of her life in this small, faraway place.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too soon, Jim,&#x201d; she said, almost in tears. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re lovely. It&#x2019;s <i>all </i>lovely. But it&#x2019;s gathering too much speed, like something rolling downhill.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;We had a bargain,&#x201d; he said sadly. &#x201c;If you didn&#x2019;t like it you were to say so.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say yes or no in twenty minutes,&#x201d; Cara begged. <br> &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s no then . . .&#x201d; His face was lined with disappointment.<br> They drove back to Jim&#x2019;s home in silence. His father and the girls were waiting inside eagerly. Rose had gone home to her mean husband, taking a plastic box of supper. Cara realized she hadn&#x2019;t known any of these people a week ago and now she was expected to come and make her life with them.<br> It wasn&#x2019;t fair. She <i>had </i>to have time to get used to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The supper wasn&#x2019;t as jolly as the lunch had been. Jim said nothing at all and one by one the others let their chatter die down.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you must be tired, Cara,&#x201d; Jim&#x2019;s father said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be needing an early night.&#x201d;<br> She looked at him gratefully.<br> &#x201c;It has been a long day. Wonderful. But it had a lot of people in it,&#x201d; she said, and there was a chorus of good nights.<br> Jim looked like a child who had lost his lollipop.<br> In her bedroom Cara sat wretched on the side of her bed. It had been such a mistake to have rushed across the country after so short a time, giving rise to expectations that couldn&#x2019;t be realized. Just as she was about to climb the stairs, Jim&#x2019;s father had given her a big folder.<br> &#x201c;You might like to read this, my dear,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my late wife&#x2019;s diary. She wrote it every day.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s too private. Too personal,&#x201d; Cara began.<br> &#x201c;No, she would have liked you to read it,&#x201d; he said.<br> So she began at the start, when Maria had first come to this place. She had marveled that anyone could live so far from the bustling city where she had been born and grew up. She could not believe that it was possible to be so far from the theater and art galleries. How could anyone look out at those stony fields and go along the narrow roads without losing part of their soul?<br> But as the pages went on, Maria began to love the place, to know the seasons, to go hunting for mushrooms, to finding sheep that had rolled over on their backs and couldn&#x2019;t get up again. Maria wrote on how she started a mobile library. She had learned to drive and took books and art books to faraway farms and villages. She got to know everyone who lived within miles around. She won�dered what she had been doing in a city of strangers, walking past people whose faces and life histories she did not know. And all through the story was a thread: even up to the very last weeks was her love for Mikey, Jim&#x2019;s father.<br> How she had been nervous of his certainty in the very start, how he was so sure she was the one for him and she feared it was a decision too quickly made.<br> She wrote on and on about Jim&#x2019;s birth and how proud she was of him and her hope that he might be like his father before him and find the right one before she died.<br> Cara didn&#x2019;t know what time it was. She looked out the window. The moon seemed high in the dark sky.<br> The orchard looked beautiful with the old trees casting curled shadows.<br> The old donkey was asleep, standing up with his head on the gate. Cara had read how Maria had rescued him from people who had been ill-treating him when he was just a foal or whatever you call a young donkey. He had never done any work, just given the children rides on his back for years.<br> Down in the farmyard the hens and geese were clucking con�tentedly behind the mesh doors that kept the beautiful red fox away from them.<br> Cara could not understand now why she had feared this place. It was very like home already . . . <br> She blessed her future father-in-law for giving her the diary. She wished she had met Jim earlier and she would have known her soon-to-be mother-in-law.<br> Yes, of course she would marry Jim. <br> She remembered counting the hours after she had said good-bye to him in Dublin last week.<br> Now she was counting the hours until morning when she could tell him that they should see the priest while they were at it. She was going to live here&#x2014;she might as well get married here.<br> After all, that&#x2019;s what Maria had done all those years ago, and she had never known a day&#x2019;s regret.</p><h2>The Fall Line</h2><p>A former investment banker who destroyed his career by laundering money for a powerful drug cartel, Jack Farrell is on the run from both the FBI and ruthless drug lords, until a deadly challenge from a seductive filmmaker puts him on a collision course with his past. Reprint.</p><p>Mark Sullivan is the acclaimed author of eighteen novels, including the #1 New York Times bestselling Private series, which he writes with James Patterson. Mark has received numerous awards for his writing, including the WHSmith Fresh Talent Award, and his works have been named a New York Times Notable Book and a Los Angeles Times Best Book of the Year. He grew up in Medfield, Massachusetts, and graduated from Hamilton College with a BA in English before working as a volunteer in the Peace Corps in Niger, West Africa. Upon his return to the United States, he earned a graduate degree from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University and began a career in investigative journalism. An avid skier and adventurer, he lives with his wife in Bozeman, Montana, where he remains grateful for the miracle of every moment.An unintriguing post-felony intrigue with a hero who gets away from it all (dead wife and child, pursuit by Latin American drug lords, burial in federal witness protection program) by hitting the slopes big time. Jack Farrell's an adrenaline addict who--we learn in flashback--responded to the crib death of his baby daughter by whisking his grieving wife, Lena, a nurse wrestling with demons he was only dimly aware of, away from Chicago to California. His boring, lucrative new job there as head of tiny San Diego First Fidelity's foreign investment department offered one chance for excitement: sending the department's capital base skyrocketing by accepting the dubious transactions of Mexican importer-exporter Gabriel Cortez. Jack gradually realized he was getting taken for a ride by a Colombian drug cartel, but he couldn't help himself: ``Farrell was now fully into the world of money-laundering, hooked on the rush, a junkie for danger.'' Now, back in a present sans Lena, his parents, his bank job, and his old identity, he takes a novel approach to going underground, agreeing to appear in megalomaniac film director Inez Didier's documentary on extreme skiing--a devil's compact that'll take him on some hair-raising downhills from Utah to Tahoe to the Tetons, with vampirish Inez constantly devising new challenges (collision-course skiing, skiing blindfolded, skiing on thawed snow) for Jack and his fellow recruits, one-eyed Matthew Page and Rastaman Jerry Milburn (a.k.a The Wave). The endless ski sequences push so hard for excitement that they become narcotizing. Like Jack, Lena, and Gabriel, Inez is battling nasty family memories (Do you think these guys could all be related?) that produce terrific footage, sex-and-power games, and broad portents of disaster. First-novelist Sullivan tries for Hemingway on powder but ends up remaking The Stunt Man with Leni Riefenstahl in the Peter O'Toole role, intercut with soporific flashbacks to a B-grade drug film. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It was Tuesday, 25 December, just past noon. The wall was thick and stubbornly hard. After each dull thump, shards of brick and cement broke off and shot across the plank floor like shrapnel. I felt sweat tracking through the dust on my face and torso. It was an oven in there, despite the open windows.<br><br>Between hammer blows I heard the phone ring. I was reluctant to break the rhythm. In this heat it would be hard to get the machine going again. Slowly, I put the long handle down and went through to the sitting room, feeling the shards under my bare feet. The phone's little screen displayed Jeanette. I wiped a grimy hand on my shorts and picked it up.<br><br>`<i>Jis</i>.'<br><br>`Merry Christmas.' Jeanette Louw's gravelly voice was loaded with inexplicable irony. As ever.<br><br>`Thanks. Same to you.'<br><br>`Must be good and hot out there ...'<br><br>`Thirty-eight outside.'<br><br>In winter she would say, `Must be nice and cold out there,' with undisguised regret about my choice of residence.<br><br>`Loxton,' she said now, as if it were a faux pas. `You'll just have to sweat it out, then. What do you do for Christmas in those parts?'<br><br>`Demolish the wall between the kitchen and the bathroom.'<br><br>`You did say the kitchen and the bathroom?'<br><br>`That's how they built them in the old days.'<br><br>`And that's how you celebrate Christmas. Old rural tradition, huh?' and she barked out a single, loud `Ha!'<br><br>I knew she hadn't phoned to wish me Happy Christmas. `You've got a job for me.'<br><br>`Uh-huh.'<br><br>`Tourist?'<br><br>`No. Woman from the Cape, actually. She says she was attacked yesterday. She wants you for a week or so, paid the deposit already.'<br><br>I thought about the money, which I needed. `Oh?'<br><br>`She's in Hermanus. I'll SMS the address and cell phone number. I'll tell her you're on your way. Call me if you have any problems.'<br>I met Emma le Roux for the first time in a beach house overlooking the Old Harbour of Hermanus. The house was impressive, three new Tuscan storeys of rich man's playground with a hand-carved wooden front door and a door knocker in the shape of a lion's head.<br><br>At a quarter to seven on Christmas night a young man with long curly hair and steel-rimmed spectacles opened the door. He introduced himself as Henk and said they were expecting me. I could see he was curious, though he hid it well. He invited me in and asked me to wait in the sitting room while he called `Miss le Roux'. A formal man. There were noises from deep in the house &#x2014; classical music, conversation. The smell of cooking.<br><br>He disappeared. I didn't sit down. After six hours' drive through the Karoo in my Isuzu, I preferred to stand. There was a Christmas tree in the room, a big artificial one with plastic pine needles and mock snow. Multicoloured lights blinked. At the top of the tree was an angel with long, blonde hair, wings spread wide like a bird of prey. Behind her the curtains of the big windows were open. The bay was lovely in the late afternoon, the sea calm and still. I stared out at it.<br><br>`Mr Lemmer?'<br><br>I turned.<br><br>She was tiny and slim. Her black hair was cut very short, almost like a man's. Her eyes were large and dark, the tips of her ears slightly pointed. She looked like a nymph from a children's story. She stood for a moment to take me in, the involuntary up-and-down look to measure me against her expectations. She hid her disappointment well. They usually expect someone bigger, more imposing &#x2014; not this general average of height and appearance.<br><br>She came up to me and put out her hand. `I'm Emma le Roux.' Her hand was warm.<br><br>`Hello.'<br><br>`Please sit down.' She gestured at the suite in the sitting room. `Can I get you something to drink?' Her voice had an unexpected timbre, as if it belonged to a larger woman.<br><br>`No thanks.'<br><br>I sat down. The movement of her petite body was fluid, as though she were completely comfortable inside it. She sat down opposite me. Tucked up her legs, at home here. I wondered whether it was her place, where the money came from.<br><br>`I, ah ...' She waved a hand. `This is a first for me, having a bodyguard ...'<br><br>I wasn't sure how to respond. The lights of the Christmas tree flicked their colours over her with monotonous regularity.<br><br>`Maybe you could explain how it works,' Emma said without embarrassment. `In practice, I mean.'<br><br>I wanted to say that if you order this service, you ought know how it works. There is no reference manual.<br><br>`It's simple really. To protect you I need to know what your movements are every day ...'<br><br>`Of course.'<br><br>`And the nature of the threat.'<br><br>She nodded. `Well ... I'm not exactly sure what the threat is. Some odd things have happened ... Carel convinced me .... You'll meet him in a moment; he's used your service before. I ... there was an attack, yesterday morning ...'<br><br>`On you?'<br><br>`Yes. Well, sort of ... They broke down the door of my house and came in.'<br><br>`They?'<br><br>`Three men.'<br><br>`Were they armed?'<br><br>`No. Yes. They, um ... It happened so fast ... I ... I hardly saw them.'<br><br>I suppressed the urge to raise my eyebrows.<br><br>`I know it sounds ... peculiar,' she said.<br><br>I said nothing.<br><br>`It was ... strange, Mr Lemmer. Sort of ... surreal.'<br><br>I nodded, encouraging her.<br><br>She looked at me intently for a moment and then leaned over to switch on a table lamp beside her.<br><br>`I have a house in Oranjezicht,' she said.<br><br>`So this is not your permanent home?'<br><br>`No ... this is Carel's place. I'm just visiting. For Christmas.'<br><br>`I see.'<br><br>`Yesterday morning ... I wanted to finish my work before packing for the weekend ... My office ... I work from home, you see. About half past nine I took a shower ...'<br><br>Her story did not flow at first. She seemed reluctant to relive it. Her sentences were incomplete, hands quiet, her voice a polite, indifferent monotone. She gave more detail than the situation warranted. Perhaps she felt it lent credibility.<br><br>After her shower, she said she was dressing in her bedroom, one leg in her jeans, precariously balanced. She heard the garden gate open and through the lace curtain she saw three men move quickly and purposefully through the front garden. Before they disappeared from her field of vision on the way to the front door, she had registered that they were wearing balaclavas. They had blunt objects in their hands.<br><br>She was a modern single woman. Aware. She had often considered the possibility of being the victim of a crime and what her emergency response could be if the worst happened. Therefore, she stepped into the other leg of her jeans and hastily pulled them up over her hips. She was half dressed in only underwear and jeans, but the priority was to get to the panic button and be ready to sound the alarm. But not to press it yet, there was still the security gate and the burglar bars. She didn't want the embarrassment of crying wolf.<br><br>Her bare feet moved swiftly across the carpet to the panic button on her bedroom wall. She lifted her finger and waited. Her heart thumped in her throat, but still she was in control. She heard the squeal of metal stubbornly bending and breaking. The security door was no longer secure. She pressed the alarm. It wailed out from the ceiling above and with the sound came a wave of panic.<br><br>Her narration seemed to draw her in and her hands began to communicate. Her voice developed a musical tone, the pitch rising.<br><br>Emma le Roux ran down the passage to the kitchen. She was fleetingly aware that burglars and thieves did not use this method. It fuelled her terror. In her haste she collided with the wooden back door with a dull thud. Her hands shook as she pulled back both bolts and turned the key in the lock. The second she jerked open the door she heard splintering in the hall, glass shattering. The front door was breached. They were in her house.<br><br>She took one step outside and stopped. Then turned back into the kitchen to grab a drying cloth from the sink. She wanted it to cover herself. Later she would scold herself for such an irrational act, but it was instinctive. Another fraction of a second she hesitated. Should she grab a weapon, a carving knife? She suppressed that impulse.<br><br>She ran into the bright sunlight with the drying cloth pressed to her breast. The neatly paved backyard was very small.<br><br>She looked at the high concrete wall that was meant to protect her, keep the world out. It was now keeping her in. For the first time she screamed `Help me!' A distress call to neighbours she did not know &#x2014; this was urban Cape Town, where you kept your distance, pulled up the drawbridge every night, kept yourself to yourself. She could hear them in the house behind her. One shouted something. Her eye caught the black rubbish bin against the concrete wall &#x2014; a step to safety.<br><br>`Help!' she called between the undulating wails of the alarm.<br><br>Emma didn't remember how she made it over the wall. But she did, in one or two adrenalin-fuelled movements. The drying cloth stayed behind in the process, so that she landed in her neighbour's yard without it. Her left knee scraped against something. She felt no pain; only later would she notice the little rip in the denim.<br><br>`Help me.' Her voice was shrill and desperate. She crossed her arms across her bosom to preserve her decency and ran to the neighbour's back door. `Help me!'<br><br>She heard the dustbin overturn and knew they were close behind. The door opened in front of her and a grizzled man in a red dressing gown with white dots came out. He had a rifle in his hand. Above his eyes the silver eyebrows grew long and dense, making wings across his forehead.<br><br>`Help me,' she said with relief in her voice.<br><br>The neighbour rested his eyes on her for a second, a grown woman with a boyish figure. Then he raised his eyebrows and his gaze to the wall behind her. He brought the rifle up to his shoulder and pointed it at the wall. She had almost reached him now and looked back. A balaclava appeared for an instant above the concrete.<br><br>The neighbour fired. The shot reverberated against the multiple walls around them and the bullet slammed into her house with a clapping sound. For three or four minutes after that she could not hear a thing. She stood close to her neighbour, trembling. He did not look at her. He worked the bolt of his rifle. A casing clinked to the cement, noiselessly to her deafened ears. The neighbour scanned the wall.<br><br>`Bastards,' he said as he aimed along the barrel. He swung the rifle horizontally to cover the whole front.<br><br>She didn't know how long they stood there. The attackers had gone. Her hearing returned with a rushing sound, then she heard the alarm again. Eventually he slowly lowered the rifle and asked her in a voice full of concern and eastern Europe, `Are you all right, my darlink?'<br><br>She began to cry.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Something Special: A Story</h2><p>Set in Dublin in the 1950s, this haunting, previously unpublished story follows Yvonne, a young Irish woman, who becomes convinced that there is more to life than marriage to Sam, the dutiful Jewish young man who is courting her, in a beautifully illustrated tale of love and repression. 15,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Iris Murdoch</b> was one of the twentieth century's most prominent novelists, winner of the Booker Prize for <i>The Sea, The Sea</i>. She died in 1999. <b>Michael McCurdy</b>, the celebrated American artist, has illustrated books by David Mamet and Edward Abbey. He lives in Massachusetts.A poor neighborhood of Dublin in the 1950s provides the setting for this stunningly affecting short story by the late Murdoch, appearing in book form for the first time. Yvonne Geary is getting on toward spinsterhood. At age 24, she is dismissive of her stolid suitor, Sam Goldman, who courts her with gentle respect. Yvonne's mother and uncle, with whom she shares shabby lodgings, urge her to marry Sam despite his being "one of the Chosen People." In fact, Sam's "not like the run of Jew-boys at all," claims Mrs. Geary, in one of her unconsciously bigoted remarks about the tribe she calls "those ones." His religion is not what Yvonne objects to in Sam; it's his dogged but mundane devotion. What she desperately wants is romance, and what she gets instead is an uproar in a seedy bar when an inebriated poet takes a fancy to her. In a poignant denouement, Yvonne understands the kind of "poetry" Sam would offer and comes to terms with the realities of her life. Despite its cutting, humorous details, this story is more wistful and gentler than much of Murdoch's work, and it gains power from illustrator Michael McCurdy's rough-hewn woodcuts. Its diminutive size (5"x7") and the fact that no further works will be forthcoming from its respected author are both strong indications for a potential stocking stuffer during the holidays.

They developed their own style, subculture, and slang and as Ch. Didier Gondola shows, engaged in a quest for manhood through bodybuilding, marijuana, violent sexual behavior, and other transgressive acts.

A writer still independent, fierce and feral. The wisdom of age hasn&#x2019;t harmed him a bit.&#x201d; David Gates, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br> His tales possess the hypnotic grace and momentum of a long-distance, freestyle swimmer, pages cleaving away like armstrokes . . .

All three of these novellas traverse Harrison&#x2019;s familiar turf: the human relation to nature, how we live in it and consume it, how we believe we can rise above our natural urges and how often that makes us fools, and how nature&#x2019;s mortal effects on humans always win in the end.&#x201d; Colette Bancroft, <i>Tampa Bay Times</i><br><br>"Harrison, who proved himself master of the novella with works like <i>Legends of the Fall</i>, serves up a trio full of his trademark humor and insight.&#x201d; Paul S.

Not just a straightforward movie guide, this is more of a Middle-earth encyclopedia with information on the people and places to which moviegoers will be introduced. The text is informative and never presumes any level of knowledge, making this book more than accessible for Tolkien fans or those who have yet to discover his work. The pictures are full color and quite simply superb, showcasing the movie's epic scope and exciting special effects. There is even a foldout map of Middle-earth in the center pages using shots from the movie to illustrate key locations, giving it a more realistic feel. Not an average movie tie-in book, Fisher's wonderful guide has been as lovingly put together as the movie itself and has "quality" stamped all over it. This is definitely one to add to your collection. <i>--Jonathan Weir, Amazon.co.uk</i>JUDE FISHER&nbsp;is a pseudonym for an established fantasy author. Her Two Towers Visual Companion was a New York Times bestseller..</p><h2>Napoleon: Life, Legacy, and Image: A Biography</h2><p><p>From Alan Forrest, a preeminent British scholar, comes an exceedingly readable account of the man and his legend</p><p> On a cold December day in 1840 Parisians turned out in force to watch as the body of Napoleon was solemnly carried on a riverboat from Courbevoie on its final journey to the Invalides. The return of their long-dead emperor's corpse from the island of St. Helena was a moment that Paris had eagerly awaited, though many feared that the memories stirred would serve to further destabilize a country that had struggled for order and direction since he had been sent into exile.</p><p>In this book Alan Forrest tells the remarkable story of how the son of a Corsican attorney became the most powerful man in Europe, a man whose charisma and legacy endured after his lonely death many thousands of miles from the country whose fate had become so entwined with his own.</p><p>Along the way, Forrest also cuts away the many layers of myth and counter myth that have grown up around Napoleon, a man who mixed history and legend promiscuously. Drawing on original research and his own distinguished background in French history, Forrest demonstrates that Napoleon was as much a product of his times as their creator.</p></p><p><p>ALAN FORREST is a professor of modern history and director of the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies. He works on modern French history, especially the period of the French Revolution and Empire, and on the history of modern warfare. He serves on the editorial boards of <i>French History</i> and <i>War in History</i>, and is a member of the advisory committee for <i>Annales Historiques de la Revolution Francaise</i>. He lives in York, UK.</p>Using biography as framework, Forrest tackles interpretive problems that attend Napol�on&#x2019;s swath through history. Did he reverse the French Revolution or consolidate its reforms? Was he a one-man band of destruction, or did France&#x2019;s adversaries bear some responsibility for the Napoleonic Wars? One challenge Forrest faces is the publicity Napol�on assiduously cultivated about himself in the press, in heroic paintings, and not least in his memoirs&#x2013;&#x2013;the Gospel according to St. Helena, to derisive historians. Forrest concedes that Napol�on&#x2019;s propaganda achieved at least popular acquiescence to his regime and also that it strengthened positive elements in his reputation as a general and as a civil administrator. Proof of France&#x2019;s thumbs-up memory of Napol�on stands in the shape of the Arc de Triomphe and his tomb in the H�tel des Invalides. But one must go elsewhere for evidence of Napol�on&#x2019;s dictatorial proclivities, such as in his execution of a Bourbon prince and his invasion of Russia against the prophetic counsel of advisers. Forrest provides another such place, for, not fooled by Napol�onic imagery, he makes a patiently remorseless case against Napol�on&#x2019;s historical legend. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Silly Symphonies Volume 4: The Complete Disney Classics 1942-1945</h2><p><b>Collect the complete <i>Silly Symphony </i>Sunday newspaper strips for the first time!</b><br><br>The artwork for these rare strips has come straight from the Disney vaults, each page meticulously colored using as a guide the original file copies that belonged to Walt Disney himself! <br><br>This concluding volume of the series features an adaptation of <i>Bambi</i>, plus the rarely seen Sunday pages featuring <i>The Three Caballeros</i> stars Jos� Carioca and Panchito from 1942 to 1945.

Hill</h2><p>First noted for his portrayal of the Depression-era South, Walker Evans (1903-1975) stands among the world&#39;s greatest photographers. One of the finest collections of Walker Evans&#39;s work in private hands is that of Marian and Benjamin A. Hill of Atlanta. 62 photographs are superbly reproduced in this book and described in an illuminating essay.</p><p>These two books honoring the great American photographer Walker Evans differ in reproduction value and selection. Signs would be slight and disappointing without the excellent text by Romanian poet and National Public Radio commentator Codrescu. The unifying idea for this book?photos that represent Evans's lifelong affection for signs?feels original and yet ultimately limiting as you flip through marvelous black-and-white images like "Roadside Stand Near Birmingham" (1936) and "What, No Garters?" (1946). Visually, the idea probably works more powerfully within the confines of the J. Paul Getty Museum exhibition. Considered purely as a kind of slide show for Codrescu's text, however, the photographs work ably. While it also contains many old favorites, Simple Secrets doesn't limit inclusion by theme. The catalog of a traveling exhibition launched by Atlanta's High Museum of Art, it has plenty of signage but includes much of the rest of the world Evans rendered so memorably. Well-known pictures seem somehow more surprising here. These photos are from the magnificent Hill Collection, which spans five decades of Evans's work, starting with his shadow self-portrait from 1927. The reproductions and layout are superior to that of Signs, and Walker's subway faces, blind musicians, and old men on porches have rarely looked better. Thirteen of the Hill Collection's photographs have never been published.

Originating with a series of creative initiatives by artists, art historians, and critics and centered in places like Budapest, Poznan, and Prague, this experimental dialogue involved Western participation but is today largely forgotten in the West. In <i>Networking the Bloc</i>, Klara Kemp-Welch vividly recaptures this lost chapter of art history, documenting an elaborate web of artistic connectivity that came about through a series of personal encounters, pioneering dialogues, collaborative projects, and cultural exchanges. Countering the conventional Cold War narrative of Eastern bloc isolation, Kemp-Welch shows how artistic ideas were relayed among like-minded artists across ideological boundaries and national frontiers.</p><p>Much of the work created was collaborative, and personal encounters were at its heart. Drawing on archival documents and interviews with participants, Kemp-Welch focuses on the exchanges and projects themselves rather than the personalities involved. Each of the projects she examines relied for its realization on a network of contributors. She looks first at the mobilization of the network, from 1964 to 1972, exploring five pioneering cases: a friendship between a Slovak artist and a French critic, an artistic credo, an exhibition, a conceptual proposition, and a book. She then charts a series of way stations for experimental art from the Soviet bloc between 1972 and 1976&#x2015;points of distribution between studios, private homes, galleries, and certain cities. Finally, she investigates convergences&#x2015;a succession of shared exhibitions and events in the second half of the 1970s in locations ranging from Prague to Milan to Moscow. <i>Networking the Bloc</i>, Kemp-Welch invites us to rethink the art of the late Cold War period from Eastern European perspectives.</p></p><p>Klara Kemp-Welch is a Lecturer in twentieth-century modernism at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London. She is the author of <i>Antipolitics in Central European Art</i>.<p>Klara Kemp-Welch's&nbsp;<i>Networking the Bloc</i>&nbsp;redefines and enriches a modernist condition of isolation and alienation and proves that a hunger for connectivity beyond local milieus fostered the experimental art of the former Soviet satellite countries. The fact that the same networking&nbsp;mindset&nbsp;fuels&nbsp;today's global art world makes this&nbsp;book an indispensable manual of how to channel gained information into original and radical art production.</p>&#x2015;<b>Margarita Tupitsyn</b>, author of&nbsp;Moscow Vanguard Art, 1922&#x2013;92 and editor of&nbsp;Russian Dada, 1914&#x2013;1924<br><br><p>Cold War myths are long-lived. One of the most persistent&#x2015;that the borders of&nbsp;Soviet&nbsp;Bloc countries were impermeable barriers&#x2015;is dashed in this deeply researched and highly readable study of the movements of artists, curators, publications, and artworks in&nbsp;what used to be known as&nbsp;Eastern&nbsp;Europe. A vital contribution to the necessary project of decentralizing art history, Klara Kemp-Welch's book provides vivid portraits of intensely experimental artists who, for far too long, could only be glimpsed at the margins.</p>&#x2015;<b>David Crowley</b>, Professor of Visual Culture, NCAD, Dublin; curator,&nbsp;Notes from the Underground: Art and Alternative Music in Eastern Europe after 1968</p><h2>The Taxidermist&#39;s Daughter: A Novel</h2><p><p>A chilling and spooky Gothic historical thriller reminiscent of <em>Rebecca</em> and <em>The Turn of the Screw</em>, dripping with the dark twists and eerie surprises that are the hallmarks of Edgar Allan Poe, from the <em>New York Times</em> and internationally bestselling author of <em>Citadel.</em></p><p>In a remote village near the English coast, residents gather in a misty churchyard.

As the new Introduction by Dr. Crocco states: "Every living physician today has been exposed to <i>Gray's Anatomy</i> and nearly everyone has used it. It was<i> Gray's Anatomy </i>that occupied most of the embryonic physician's waking hours, whether at home or at the side of his cadaver.<br>"There have been many imitations, but few real competitors. There have been dissection manuals and pictorial atlases brilliantly illustrated with exquisite photographs. There have been synopses of anatomy and there have been monographs on various regions of the body. However, there is only one <i>Gray's Anatomy.<br>"</i>This stellar book represents the acme of anatomical description over the last century and will probably still be the premier text in anatomy over the next one hundred years. This commemorative edition is a very fitting tribute to Dr. Henry Gray, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, whose colossal work will be remembered by medical historians past and future and by twentieth-century physicians and surgeons as the anatomy text of our age."</p><p>The leg bone's connected to the hip bone, and so on. For many of us, anatomy can seem intimidating and unrewarding, but the right teacher can clear such feelings away in a heartbeat. Our fascination with our bodies is a powerful force, and once we start looking, we find that beauty is much more than skin-deep.<p> It so happens that the right teacher can take the form of a book. <i>Gray's Anatomy</i> is one of those few titles that practically everybody has heard of, and with good reason--it is a scientific and artistic triumph. Not just a dry index of parts and names, <i>Gray's</i> lets the natural beauty and grace of the body's interconnected systems and structures shine forth from the page. Using sumptuous illustrations and clear, matter-of-fact descriptions, Dr. Gray unleashed a classic on the world more than 100 years ago. Its clarity and usefulness keep it in print today. Whether you want to understand yourself or others, knowledge of our physical parts and how they fit together is essential. <i>Gray's Anatomy</i> provides that information in a simple, timeless format that cleanly dissects a body of knowledge grown over centuries. This book will not only fill the needs of people in the medical profession, but will please artists and naturalists as well. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p></p><h2>Common Sense and Other Writings (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p><i>Common Sense and Other Writings</i>, by <b>Thomas Paine</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

His rousing, radical voice was balanced by the equally independence-minded but more measured tones of Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence later that year.<br><br>In later works, such as <i>The Rights of Man</i>, <i>The Age of Reason</i>, and other selections included in this volume, Paine proved himself a visionary moralist centuries ahead of his time. He believed that every human has the natural right to life&#x2019;s necessities and that government&#x2019;s role should be to provide for those in dire need. An impassioned opponent of all forms of slavery, he understood that no one in poverty is truly free, a lesson still to be learned by many of our leaders today.&nbsp;<b>Joyce Appleby</b>, Professor Emerita at the University of California, Los Angeles, has followed the trajectory of American nation-building in her books <i>Capitalism and a New Social Order: The Republican Vision of the 1790s</i>, <i>Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans</i>, <i>Thomas Jefferson</i>, and <i>A Restless Past: History and the American Public</i>. <br></p><p><b>Includes the complete texts of <i>Common Sense; Rights of Man, Part the Second; The Age of Reason</i> (part one); <i>Four Letters on Interesting Subjects</i>, published anonymously and just discovered to be Paine's work; and <i>Letter to the Abb� Raynal,</i> Paine's first examination of world events; as well as selections from <i>The American Crises</i></b> <p>In 1776, America was a hotbed of enlightenment and revolution.

But in the 1920s Jewish residents began to scatter to other parts of Manhattan, to the outer boroughs, and to other cities. Now nearly a century later, Jews are returning uptown to a gentrified Harlem. <br><br><i>The Jews of Harlem</i> follows Jews into, out of, and back into this renowned metropolitan neighborhood over the course of a century and a half. It analyzes the complex set of forces that brought several generations of central European, East European, and Sephardic Jews to settle there. It explains the dynamics that led Jews to exit this part of Gotham as well as exploring the enduring Jewish presence uptown after it became overwhelmingly black and decidedly poor. And it looks at the beginnings of Jewish return as part of the transformation of New York City in our present era. <i>The Jews of Harlem</i> contributes much to our understanding of Jewish and African American history in the metropolis as it highlights the ever-changing story of America&#x2019;s largest city. <br><br>With <i>The Jews of Harlem</i>, the beginning of Dunlap&#x2019;s hoped-for resurfacing of this neighborhood&#x2019;s history is underway.

(<i>American Jewish Archives Journal</i>)<br><br>"Gurock traces anew the history of Jewish Harlem, a subject he first explored in When Harlem Was Jewish, 1870-1930. While the earlier work told the story of an important, but largely forgotten, community, this well-written, comprehensive study examines a neighborhood whose history "is not over, but rather a work in progress"... this book is not merely a localized case study, but one that has great significance for Jewish American as a whole." (<i>Journal of American Ethnic History</i>)<br><br>"The Jews of Harlemis a masterful work of scholarship that further concretizes Jeffrey Gurock's position as a preeminent academic practitioner. In parallel, it offers the reader a unique perspective from which to witness transitions in American Judaism, as well as the way one of its prime chroniclers interfaces with the story he tells." (<i>Journal of Religion</i>)<br><br>"This well-written volume makes clear that the Harlem Jewish community significantly influenced American Jewry as a whole . . . This is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of American Judaism." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"What stays with you long after you have finished [The Jews of Harlem] is Gurock's steadfast devotion to his subject." (<i>Jewish Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"<p>"Jeffrey Gurock has done it again! His well-crafted narrative presents a convincing history of Parkchesters transition from a whites-only melting pot to a complex and racially diverse alternative to suburbia. Gurock raises significant questions that are persuasively answered by his solid research and clear-eyed analysis. His chapters throb with real life tensions and controversies, and finally with lessons about how reason and comity ultimately can prevail over intolerance.</p>" (Thomas Kessner,The Graduate Center, City University of New York)<br><br>"Jeffrey Gurock offers an evocative account of the evolution of Jewish Harlem. This book is a 'must read' for anyone interested in race, religion, and culture in New York's ever-changing neighborhood." (Beth S. Wenger,Professor of History, University of Pennsylvania)<br><br>"Nearly forty years after the publication of his first monograph,When Harlem Was Jewish, 18701930(1979), Jeffrey S. Gurock has returned to Harlem, revisiting the story of the Jewish communitys beginnings in the 1870s and 1880s, its heyday in the early twentieth century, and its rapid decline after World War I, and adding something that seemed unlikely in the 1970s: the return of Jews to the neighborhood." (<i>The American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"Jeffrey Gurock is the historian of Jewish Harlem, but he is also its anthropologist and sociologist. He chronicles the fortunes of this storied neighborhood treasured by blacks and Jews and now home to both groups with the fresh-eyed relish of an explorer discovering a new land yet with the authority of an old-timer intimately familiar with every block and alley. He has populated his fascinating tale of Jewish Harlem's development, decline, and resurgence not just with events and institutions but with flesh and blood people who bring the community to vivid life." (Joseph Berger,author of The Pious Ones: The World of Hasidim and Their Battles with America)<br><br>"The Jews of Harlem skillfully traces Jewish Harlem from its tentative beginnings to the years when Jewish life there rivaled that of the Lower East Side, and from the massive migration elsewhere to the community's even more tentative reemergence today. It's an important piece of American Jewish history."

While on vacation in Europe his life was changed forever when he was bitten by a lycanthrope and cursed to walk the earth for the rest of eternity as an immortal monster driven by rage and an unstoppable hunger for human prey. No longer a man, not fully a beast, Talbot was one of the damned: a werewolf. After apparently dying at the hands of his loved ones, Talbot awakes in the back of a car hurtling down a deserted road, evading gunfire from another vehicle in hot pursuit. The driver of his car gets him to safety and informs him the persons following them are from a heretical cult dedicated to the extermination of all those marked by the sign of the Wolf. As Talbot places his trust in the hands of these new friends, an order whose stated mission is to protect werewolves, and learns of the origins of the werewolf curse, he slowly starts to realize that he is actually in more danger than he could imagine and that his saviors have evil intentions all their own for him.</p><p></p><h2>Uncommon Places</h2><p>Photographs vividly depict landscapes and daily life in cities and rural areas across the country</p><p>At the age of 24, <b>Stephen Shore</b> became the first living photographer to have a one-man show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

These 152 full-page, full-color shots comprise his serial project of the 70s, "Uncommon Places," which documented roadside America with a dispassionate, Andy-like emptiness. It&#x2019;s an aesthetic that has been endlessly co-opted by American filmmakers like Gus Van Sant and Jim Jarmusch, but some of these 12 7/8" � 10 5/16" shots of prairies, parking lots, polyester-clad couples and plastic hotel furnishings manage to seem fresh nonetheless.

As a first-year associate, Nelson blindly accepted a ``little pro bono project.'' She had no idea she was committing the next three years of her life to representing a man who had murdered (approximately) 35 young women. She had no idea that her client, a manic-depressive law school dropout, would repeatedly attempt to sabotage her representation, or that her law firm--Washington DC's white-shoe, politically connected Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering- -``would come to think that [she] had saddled them with this unsavory million-dollar case''; ultimately, they would fire her for her zealous, single-minded advocacy. Nor did she realize that her true opponents in the case would be not the prosecutors but the state and federal courts intent on executing her despised client, no matter what evidence of his insanity she presented. But Nelson's most profound lesson was that she could not focus exclusively on the constitutional issues of Bundy's appeal (such as his incompetence in representing himself, as he had insisted on doing at trial). Somehow, she had to come to grips with the ``absolute misogyny'' of her defendant's bestiality. She had to be able to answer the question posed by every reporter who thrust a microphone in her face: ``What about the victims?'' Nelson quotes liberally from the court record as she recreates the labyrinthine complexity of the death-row appeals process, but you don't have to be a lawyer to appreciate her epiphany as a litigator: ``The best approach is to gladly embrace all the facts, no matter what, and show that every last one of them only reinforce the unassailable correctness of your position''--namely, that capital punishment is murder, and Bundy, executed in 1989, didn't deserve to die. Both a stunningly candid personal story and a fascinating dissection of a misunderstood case. Deserves a wide readership. (First printing of 25,000) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Born at the end of the 17th century, their lives were disrupted by their father Henry's refusal to distance himself from the Covenanters. He was imprisoned for daring to continue his ministry.</p><br><p>Poor health led to Henry's sentence being commuted to exile in England, enabling him to continue to preach in the border counties. It was here that God used him to bring a young Thomas Boston to faith. </p><br><br><p>Both Ralph and Ebenezer were ordained into the Church of Scotland but Ebenezer was only converted after he was ordained. The difference in the effect of his sermons was remarkable. Thousands flocked to hear him from as far as sixty miles away. When he later ministered in Stirling the whole town was affected.</p><br><br><p>Erskine also continued to be at the centre of debates within the church. He was formally rebuked by the General Assembly over the 'Marrow' controversy in 1722 and suspended from office over the issue of 'Patronage' in 1732. Ebenezer and three other suspended ministers formed the Associated Presbytery and continued to fight for reform within the Church of Scotland.</p><br><br><p>Arguments continued, first with George Whitefield (an affair that started with misunderstanding, escalated to intemperate language and was later reconciled) and later within the fledgling denomination over whether or not it was permissible to take an oath.</p><br><br><p>Despite these diversions Ebenezer's influence on the theological landscape of Scotland was deep. He was a great user of illustrations in his sermons, a pioneer even. He also radiated a warm, experiential, Christ-centred Christianity that was as true of his words as of his life.<br></p></p><p>An 18th century who saw thousands revived and reformed under his ministryThe beauties of Ebenezer Erskine&#39; offers the best portions of his sermons...

Vibrant illustrations and a spare text come together in this striking picture book to tell the story of the building of Manhattan. There was a time when the city was little more than an undeveloped island. But as the small patch of land shifted from Native American to Dutch to English to American hands, it was built, layer on top of layer, into the bustling metropolis it is today.<p>With illustrations so detailed that one look just won't be enough, this book explores the city's many layers and shows they're still visible, as long as you know where to look! A time line and bibliography are included.<br><br></p></p><p>Laura Vila studied art at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Pratt Institute. She lives in New York City, and this is her first book.Kindergarten-Grade 4&#x2014;"Long ago, before maps or words were used, a little island formed." This engaging picture book traces the dramatic changes that Manhattan has undergone through the centuries as animals, people, and buildings have filled it in different ways. Each spread jumps to a new era, with a sentence or two to describe the period and pictures that reveal much more. The art is rendered in a folk-art style, with purposeful shifts in line, perspective, and composition that give each spread a distinct feel. Strong vertical lines capture the "skinny row houses" of 100 years ago, sweeping curves show the arrival of more and more people in the mid-20th century, and a bird's-eye view of modern skyscrapers shows how "it grew and it grew and people still come." Though conditions change, every scene conveys excitement and wonder at the ever-changing, always-busy island. The broad tableaux include smaller details that fill in some intriguing specifics from each period, such as the mixture of automobiles and horse-drawn vehicles crossing the Brooklyn Bridge in 1909 and the many historical people and events represented on an 18th-century quilt. Sharp eyes will also spot a ubiquitous pair of mice. A time line provides further background, including dates, for each illustration. This is an effective visual presentation that introduces the history of Manhattan and also explores how places change over time.&#x2014;<i>Steven Engelfried, Multnomah County Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her father, Edwin Hodgson, dies when Frances was three years old. For several years afterward, Frances's Mother, Eliza Boond Hodgson, supported herself and her five children by running the family's household furnishings business. In 1865, Mrs. Hodgson brought her family to the United States to join a relative in Tennessee. Frances spent many happy hours reading, writing, and observing nature in the woods of Tennessee. At the age of eighteen, Frances began sending short stories to magazine publishers, and in a short time was a successful author. She married Dr. Swan Burnett in 1873. During her long career, Frances wrote a great number of varied works, but she is best remembered for her much-loved children's books, which include The Secret Garden, A Little Princess, and Little Lord Fauntleroy. Frances died in 1924 in Plandome, Long Island. <p>Judith Ann Griffith grew up in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where she spent much of her childhood drawing and exploring the countryside around her home.

A little rooster lives there, too. "What a nice little rooster you have here," everyone says when they come to visit. Indeed, it seems so for a while. But then the rooster begins to take more food for himself, and the hens get less. When the hens try talking to him about fairness, they're not prepared for his reaction. The rooster turns into an egotistical barnyard bully, and the hens are worse off than before. Finally, the oldest hen puts her foot down: "We can't go on like this.

When the hesitant hens finally question him, the chauvinistic fowl is outraged and further reduces the amount of food that they receive. Meanwhile, he is working on a mysterious project that is only conveyed using sophisticated visual clues. At times, the text is abrupt in its transitions. For example: We'll take a course in self-esteem faces a page that says, The hens were feeling dizzy when they got off the bus. The art that accompanies this spread is equally confusing. Otherwise, the illustrations are expressive, clearly delineated watercolors filled with funny details. Humor abounds in the art, but many youngsters are unlikely to understand the tension that mounts around this gender-related theme.<i>&#x2013;Kirsten Cutler, Sonoma Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Slowly, I put the long handle down and went through to the sitting room, feeling the shards under my bare feet. The phone's little screen displayed Jeanette. I wiped a grimy hand on my shorts and picked it up.<br><br>`<i>Jis</i>.'<br><br>`Merry Christmas.' Jeanette Louw's gravelly voice was loaded with inexplicable irony. As ever.<br><br>`Thanks. Same to you.'<br><br>`Must be good and hot out there ...'<br><br>`Thirty-eight outside.'<br><br>In winter she would say, `Must be nice and cold out there,' with undisguised regret about my choice of residence.<br><br>`Loxton,' she said now, as if it were a faux pas. `You'll just have to sweat it out, then. What do you do for Christmas in those parts?'<br><br>`Demolish the wall between the kitchen and the bathroom.'<br><br>`You did say the kitchen and the bathroom?'<br><br>`That's how they built them in the old days.'<br><br>`And that's how you celebrate Christmas. Old rural tradition, huh?' and she barked out a single, loud `Ha!'<br><br>I knew she hadn't phoned to wish me Happy Christmas. `You've got a job for me.'<br><br>`Uh-huh.'<br><br>`Tourist?'<br><br>`No. Woman from the Cape, actually. She says she was attacked yesterday. She wants you for a week or so, paid the deposit already.'<br><br>I thought about the money, which I needed. `Oh?'<br><br>`She's in Hermanus. I'll SMS the address and cell phone number. I'll tell her you're on your way. Call me if you have any problems.'<br>I met Emma le Roux for the first time in a beach house overlooking the Old Harbour of Hermanus. The house was impressive, three new Tuscan storeys of rich man's playground with a hand-carved wooden front door and a door knocker in the shape of a lion's head.<br><br>At a quarter to seven on Christmas night a young man with long curly hair and steel-rimmed spectacles opened the door. He introduced himself as Henk and said they were expecting me. I could see he was curious, though he hid it well. He invited me in and asked me to wait in the sitting room while he called `Miss le Roux'. A formal man. There were noises from deep in the house &#x2014; classical music, conversation. The smell of cooking.<br><br>He disappeared. I didn't sit down. After six hours' drive through the Karoo in my Isuzu, I preferred to stand. There was a Christmas tree in the room, a big artificial one with plastic pine needles and mock snow. Multicoloured lights blinked. At the top of the tree was an angel with long, blonde hair, wings spread wide like a bird of prey. Behind her the curtains of the big windows were open. The bay was lovely in the late afternoon, the sea calm and still. I stared out at it.<br><br>`Mr Lemmer?'<br><br>I turned.<br><br>She was tiny and slim. Her black hair was cut very short, almost like a man's. Her eyes were large and dark, the tips of her ears slightly pointed. She looked like a nymph from a children's story. She stood for a moment to take me in, the involuntary up-and-down look to measure me against her expectations. She hid her disappointment well. They usually expect someone bigger, more imposing &#x2014; not this general average of height and appearance.<br><br>She came up to me and put out her hand. `I'm Emma le Roux.' Her hand was warm.<br><br>`Hello.'<br><br>`Please sit down.' She gestured at the suite in the sitting room. `Can I get you something to drink?' Her voice had an unexpected timbre, as if it belonged to a larger woman.<br><br>`No thanks.'<br><br>I sat down. The movement of her petite body was fluid, as though she were completely comfortable inside it. She sat down opposite me. Tucked up her legs, at home here. I wondered whether it was her place, where the money came from.<br><br>`I, ah ...' She waved a hand. `This is a first for me, having a bodyguard ...'<br><br>I wasn't sure how to respond. The lights of the Christmas tree flicked their colours over her with monotonous regularity.<br><br>`Maybe you could explain how it works,' Emma said without embarrassment. `In practice, I mean.'<br><br>I wanted to say that if you order this service, you ought know how it works. There is no reference manual.<br><br>`It's simple really. To protect you I need to know what your movements are every day ...'<br><br>`Of course.'<br><br>`And the nature of the threat.'<br><br>She nodded. `Well ... I'm not exactly sure what the threat is. Some odd things have happened ... Carel convinced me .... You'll meet him in a moment; he's used your service before. I ... there was an attack, yesterday morning ...'<br><br>`On you?'<br><br>`Yes. Well, sort of ... They broke down the door of my house and came in.'<br><br>`They?'<br><br>`Three men.'<br><br>`Were they armed?'<br><br>`No. Yes. They, um ... It happened so fast ... I ... I hardly saw them.'<br><br>I suppressed the urge to raise my eyebrows.<br><br>`I know it sounds ... peculiar,' she said.<br><br>I said nothing.<br><br>`It was ... strange, Mr Lemmer. Sort of ... surreal.'<br><br>I nodded, encouraging her.<br><br>She looked at me intently for a moment and then leaned over to switch on a table lamp beside her.<br><br>`I have a house in Oranjezicht,' she said.<br><br>`So this is not your permanent home?'<br><br>`No ... this is Carel's place. I'm just visiting. For Christmas.'<br><br>`I see.'<br><br>`Yesterday morning ... I wanted to finish my work before packing for the weekend ... My office ... I work from home, you see. About half past nine I took a shower ...'<br><br>Her story did not flow at first. She seemed reluctant to relive it. Her sentences were incomplete, hands quiet, her voice a polite, indifferent monotone. She gave more detail than the situation warranted. Perhaps she felt it lent credibility.<br><br>After her shower, she said she was dressing in her bedroom, one leg in her jeans, precariously balanced. She heard the garden gate open and through the lace curtain she saw three men move quickly and purposefully through the front garden. Before they disappeared from her field of vision on the way to the front door, she had registered that they were wearing balaclavas. They had blunt objects in their hands.<br><br>She was a modern single woman. Aware. She had often considered the possibility of being the victim of a crime and what her emergency response could be if the worst happened. Therefore, she stepped into the other leg of her jeans and hastily pulled them up over her hips. She was half dressed in only underwear and jeans, but the priority was to get to the panic button and be ready to sound the alarm. But not to press it yet, there was still the security gate and the burglar bars. She didn't want the embarrassment of crying wolf.<br><br>Her bare feet moved swiftly across the carpet to the panic button on her bedroom wall. She lifted her finger and waited. Her heart thumped in her throat, but still she was in control. She heard the squeal of metal stubbornly bending and breaking. The security door was no longer secure. She pressed the alarm. It wailed out from the ceiling above and with the sound came a wave of panic.<br><br>Her narration seemed to draw her in and her hands began to communicate. Her voice developed a musical tone, the pitch rising.<br><br>Emma le Roux ran down the passage to the kitchen. She was fleetingly aware that burglars and thieves did not use this method. It fuelled her terror. In her haste she collided with the wooden back door with a dull thud. Her hands shook as she pulled back both bolts and turned the key in the lock. The second she jerked open the door she heard splintering in the hall, glass shattering. The front door was breached. They were in her house.<br><br>She took one step outside and stopped. Then turned back into the kitchen to grab a drying cloth from the sink. She wanted it to cover herself. Later she would scold herself for such an irrational act, but it was instinctive. Another fraction of a second she hesitated. Should she grab a weapon, a carving knife? She suppressed that impulse.<br><br>She ran into the bright sunlight with the drying cloth pressed to her breast. The neatly paved backyard was very small.<br><br>She looked at the high concrete wall that was meant to protect her, keep the world out. It was now keeping her in. For the first time she screamed `Help me!' A distress call to neighbours she did not know &#x2014; this was urban Cape Town, where you kept your distance, pulled up the drawbridge every night, kept yourself to yourself. She could hear them in the house behind her. One shouted something. Her eye caught the black rubbish bin against the concrete wall &#x2014; a step to safety.<br><br>`Help!' she called between the undulating wails of the alarm.<br><br>Emma didn't remember how she made it over the wall. But she did, in one or two adrenalin-fuelled movements. The drying cloth stayed behind in the process, so that she landed in her neighbour's yard without it. Her left knee scraped against something. She felt no pain; only later would she notice the little rip in the denim.<br><br>`Help me.' Her voice was shrill and desperate. She crossed her arms across her bosom to preserve her decency and ran to the neighbour's back door. `Help me!'<br><br>She heard the dustbin overturn and knew they were close behind. The door opened in front of her and a grizzled man in a red dressing gown with white dots came out. He had a rifle in his hand. Above his eyes the silver eyebrows grew long and dense, making wings across his forehead.<br><br>`Help me,' she said with relief in her voice.<br><br>The neighbour rested his eyes on her for a second, a grown woman with a boyish figure. Then he raised his eyebrows and his gaze to the wall behind her. He brought the rifle up to his shoulder and pointed it at the wall. She had almost reached him now and looked back. A balaclava appeared for an instant above the concrete.<br><br>The neighbour fired. The shot reverberated against the multiple walls around them and the bullet slammed into her house with a clapping sound. For three or four minutes after that she could not hear a thing. She stood close to her neighbour, trembling. He did not look at her. He worked the bolt of his rifle. A casing clinked to the cement, noiselessly to her deafened ears. The neighbour scanned the wall.<br><br>`Bastards,' he said as he aimed along the barrel. He swung the rifle horizontally to cover the whole front.<br><br>She didn't know how long they stood there. The attackers had gone. Her hearing returned with a rushing sound, then she heard the alarm again. Eventually he slowly lowered the rifle and asked her in a voice full of concern and eastern Europe, `Are you all right, my darlink?'<br><br>She began to cry.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Hadrian&#39;s Villa and Its Legacy</h2><p>The great Villa constructed by the Emperor Hadrian near Tivoli between A.D. 118 and the 130s is one of the most original monuments in the history of architecture and art.

But his life is in danger and she must let herself be drawn into a mystery that dates back to the Regency era to save him.</p><p>Joan Wolf lives in Milford, Connecticut, with her husband and two children. In her spare time she rides her horse, walks her dog, and roots fanatically for the New York Yankees and UConn Huskies.After years of writing historicals, Wolf (The Poisoned Serpent) leaps into the contemporary romantic suspense arena with this smart, compelling read. Unlike some who have floundered making the jump, Wolf delivers characters who, for the most part, move easily in their modern skins, and she wisely incorporates her historical strengths through Regency-era ghosts. When American movie star Tracy Collins first sees the English estate of Silverbridge, she's jolted by an odd sense of recognition. Even more powerful is her immediate attraction to the current earl, Harry Oliver. Neither experience, however, prepares her for the star-crossed ghost lovers who bear an eerie resemblance to her and Harry. Telling himself he's too busy to deal with a movie star, Harry tries to ignore his feelings for Tracy as he fends off a developer's bid to buy a portion of his ancestral estate. But when suspicious fires break out and Harry's brake lines are cut, the two must join forces to discover the villain. The novel's weaknesses lie mostly with Tracy, who favors such clunkers as "As I have discovered, to my sorrow," and a too-British use of "ghastly." Her contentment to call a man her own age "my lord" also rings false. But Wolf certainly hasn't plunged in over her head with this shift. As always, she paints both conflict and setting with a sure hand. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Garland of Bones: Child Runaways in India (Yale Agrarian Studies Series)</h2><p><b>An intimate portrait of India&#x2019;s child runaways, and the sociopolitical forces shaping their lives</b><br><br> This intimate portrait examines the tracks, journeys, and experiences of child runaways in northern India.

The &#34;steam&#34; refers to steam power - as in fire-breathing machines of antique locomotion. The &#34;punk&#34; is an important reference to an outsider attitude. In The Art of Steampunk, you&#39;ll discover the captivating and dynamic world of this emerging genre through the creative vision of today&#39;s leading Steampunk artists, all featured in the world&#39;s first museum exhibit of Steampunk, held at The Museum of the History of Science at Oxford University in England. No longer satisfied with the plastic design of today&#39;s mass-produced products, these artists are crafting a romantic new standard for modern goods by applying the characteristics of Steampunk. Their artwork consists of everything from jewelry and watches to light fixtures and clocks, every piece demonstrating hours of painstaking work and unlimited devotion. You will find that many of the artists are as unique and colorful as their masterpieces, often adopting alter egos of Victorian mad scientists and world explorers, allowing themselves to become fully immersed int he imaginative and exciting world of Steampunk.Art Donovan is the owner of Donovan Design, a handmade lighting company with clients like Tiffany &amp; Co, Bennetti Luxury Yachts, and Four Seasons Resorts.

Its records reach all the way back to the Domesday Book of 1086 and forward to the vast accumulation of census records, probate documents, and emigration records that make it a natural magnet for anyone undertaking English or Welsh genealogical research. The purpose of this book is to help North Americans make the most effective use of its records. Significantly, it also identifies many of the most important PRO records available in large North American institutions such as the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., and the National Archives of Canada in Ottawa. Among the topics covered in the book are emigration and immigration records; censuses; nonconformist church records; birth, death, and marriage records, and military, taxation, court, and Parliamentary records. Also included are logistical information about working at the PRO, a discussion regarding the organization of PRO records, and a list of aids for identifying the records--not to mention a comprehensive bibliography containing complete citations to every book mentioned in the text, and a subject index. Highlights of the new 2nd edition include the creation of a new PRO research facility in central London called the Family Records Centre, featuring microfilm copies of census records and records of births, marriages, and deaths, etc.; the PRO&#39;s amazing progress in making its services and records available on the Internet; and the latest addresses, telephone numbers, and fax numbers for local record offices in England and Wales.</p><p>This inexpensive and clearly written guide will save Americans who travel to England for genealogical research many hours of frustration. It constantly emphasizes the need for preparation before visiting and warns about the delays that may be experienced in the delivery of documents. After extolling the vast quantities of material to be found, it bluntly states that, "However, the PRO is not the place to begin a genealogical enquiry." What is the PRO? It is a collection, somewhat similar to our National Archives, of all documentation resulting from legal, marital, civil, military, religious, and other decisions that have affected the lives of British citizens.<p>The book starts with helpful details on how to reach the new building in Kew by Underground, bus, or private car and adds details about getting a reader's ticket, photocopying, and the like. It then offers a list of document codes, such as the AO group (Exchecquer and Audit), the PROB group (Prerogative Court of Canterbury), and so on. There is also a list of guides (some of them only leaflets) that should be read before arrival. The bulk of the text is made up of general descriptions of the various kinds of documents within each grouping--emigration, censuses, births, deaths and marriages, army, prisoners, wills, etc. There are also maps of the counties, both before and after the boundary changes of 1974.

(The PRO is the English equivalent of the National Archives in Canada and the United States.) Though it has rich holdings and unique source materials, it is not the place to begin a genealogy inquiry. One of Reid's objectives is to help researchers identify many of the PRO records that may be available from other, more convenient institutions. After helping distinguish the "when" and "why," she gives helpful logistical information for consulting the PRO. From then on she focuses on areas of particular interest to North American researchers. She covers records pertaining to emigration and immigration along with other principal record classes.

Inspired by the example of American freedom and justice, a movement in Franconia among the peasants, who have revolted several times even before the arrival from the future of the town of Grantville, an independent revolutionary movement has arisen, flying the banner of the head of a ram. The West Virginians fully approve of liberating the peasants from the nobility, but they are also aware of how revolutionary movements can lead to bloodbaths. And avoiding that deadly possibility will require all of their future knowledge and all their plain old American horse-trading diplomacy. . . .</p><p>Eric Flint's impressive first novel, Mother of Demons (Baen), was selected by SF Chronicle as one of the best novels of 1997.

By examining how rhetoric&#x2014;particularly visual rhetoric&#x2014;has worked to shape our views of nature and the &#x201c;natural&#x201d; place of humans, <i>Observation Points </i>offers insights into questions of representation, including the formation of national identity.</p><p>As Thomas Patin reveals, the term &#x201c;nature&#x201d; is artificial and unstable, in need of constant maintenance and reconstruction. The process of stabilizing its representation, he notes, is unavoidably political. America&#x2019;s national parks and monuments show how visual rhetoric operates to naturalize and stabilize representations of the environment. As contributors demonstrate, visual rhetoric is often transparent, structuring experience while remaining hidden in plain sight. Scenic overlooks and turnouts frame views for tourists. Visitor centers, with their display cases and photographs and orientation films, provide their own points of view&#x2014;literally and figuratively. Guidebooks, brochures, and other publications present still other ways of seeing. At the same time, images of America&#x2019;s &#x201c;natural&#x201d; world have long been employed for nationalist and capitalist ends, linking expansionism with American greatness and the &#x201c;natural&#x201d; triumph of European Americans over Native Americans.</p><p>The essays collected here cover a wide array of subjects, including park architecture, landscape painting, public ceremonies, and techniques of display. Contributors are from an equally broad range of disciplines&#x2014;art history, geography, museum studies, political science, American studies, and many other fields. Together they advance a provocative new visual genealogy of representation.</p><p>Contributors: Robert M.

Every aspect of human affairs was touched by them, and the style of war was transformed. Participants in the 1914-18 conflict were to witness the birth of air combat, the first true underwater war, the use of the internal combustion engine and radio-telegraphy for military ends, and the appearance of chemical warfare. This flood of inventions and developments - coinciding, as it did, with rising levels of industrialization and unprecedented increases in population - ensured that a whole generation would be virtually wiped out before the guns were silenced. John Terraine has studied World War I from various angles - military, political, economic, psychological, ideological - and here, in this book, he concentrates on the nuts and bolts, the technology of the war. His study is set against the background of the strategy of the high commands, which proved tactically so difficult to implement; the armies of the Western Front grinding to a halt and digging in, contrasting so starkly with the sweeping movements in the east; the desperate attempts to break out of the deadlock by means both orthodox and unorthodox, using all the tricks that the new technology could offer; the fighting that wore down all the armies involved; and the final push that, at last, stopped the carnage.</p><p></p><h2>Francisco Vasquez De Coronado: Famous Journeys to the American Southwest and Colonial New Mexico (Library of Explorers and Exploration)</h2><p>Traces the life and exploration of Francisco V�asquez de Coronado, who led an expedition in search of the Seven Cities of Gold which led to the exploration of the American Southwest.</p><p></p><h2>Mythological Monsters of Ancient Greece</h2><p>Meet the living, fire-breathing mythical creatures of Greek legned. One-hundred-eyed Argus; one-eyed Cyclopes; nine-headed Hydra; Cerberus, the three-headed watchdog; Medusa the Gorgon; Minotaur, half-man, half-bull; Sirens, half-woman, half-vulture; Sphinx, half-woman, half-winged lion; Centaurs, half-man, half-horse; Harpies, greedy women with bird&#39;s heads; sea-monster Scylla; fire-breathing Chimaera; Echidna and her monstrous children...meet the mythological monsters of Ancient Greece in this fabulous, fantastical, quirky and informative introduction by talented picture book maker, Sara Fanelli.</p><p>Sara Fanelli is one of the world&#39;s most distinctive picture-book creators. Born and raised in Florence, she now lives in London, but often travels between the two cities. She loves cakes and chocolate, her dog Bubu, maps and the moon. Among Sara&#39;s other titles are Wolf; My Map Book; Button; the Cinderella and Pinocchio Picture Boxes; and the acclaimed title Dear Diary, which received an Honourable Mention from the 2001 Bologna Ragazzi Award Jury. Sara lives in north London.In wild hand-lettered collages that defy academic treatments of myth, Fanelli (Dear Diary) summarizes some famous monsters of the Greek pantheon. Her portraits of weird creatures range from the comical to the grotesque, and recall the visceral imagery of Hendrik Drescher. On the imposing dust jacket and in the first spread, hundred-eyed Argus roars like a lion, but wry humor softens his threat; doodled spectacles litter the ground at his feet ("After his death, the goddess Hera put his eyes onto the tail feathers of the peacock"). Argus isn't the only one with creepy peepers. All 14 members of this sinister menagerie gaze out at readers through black-and-white magazine clippings of human eyes, which lend an uncanny appearance to Oedipus's Sphinx ("not the same as the Egyptian Sphinx") and Medusa (pictured with a scary, furry visage). Six-headed Scylla waves forks and knives as she dines upon sailors, the nine-headed Hydra squares off against Heracles ("He buried her immortal head under a huge rock") and a Satyr raises two martini glasses while "having a grand old time." Similar in approach to John Harris and Calef Brown's Greece! Rome! Monsters!, Fanelli's volume, with its rough-hewn paint-and-collage style, leaves little room for storytelling. On the spread featuring the Minotaur, for instance, the author pictures Icarus and notes that Daedalus designed the Labyrinth, but does not explain their association (father-son). Readers who know basic mythology will make the most of this visual summary.

In the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>All In</i>, military expert Paula Broadwell examines Petraeus's career, his intellectual development as a military officer, and his impact on the U.S. military.<p></p><p>Afforded extensive access by General Petraeus, his mentors, his subordinates, and his longtime friends, Broadwell reported on the front lines of fighting and at the strategic command in Afghanistan to chronicle the experiences of this American general as they were brought to bear in the terrible crucible of war. <i>All In </i>draws on hundreds of hours of exclusive interviews with Petraeus and his top officers and soldiers to tell the inside story of this commander's development and leadership in war.<br><br>When Petraeus assumed command in Afghanistan in July 2010, the conflict looked as bleak as at any moment in America's nine years on the ground there. Petraeus's defining idea&#x2014;counterinsurgency&#x2014;was immediate put to its most difficult test: the hard lessons learned during the surge in Iraq were to be applied in a radically different theater. <i>All In </i>examines the impact in Afghanistan of new counterinsurgency as well as counterterrorism strategies through the commands of several Petraeus prot�g�s.<br><br>Broadwell examines his evolution as a solider from his education at West Point in the wake of Vietnam to his earlier service in Central America, Haiti, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Iraq. <i>All In </i>also documents the general's role in the war in Washington, going behind the scenes of negotiations during policy reviews of the war in Afghanistan in Congress, the Pentagon, and the White House. <br><br>Broadwell ultimately appraises Petraeus's impact on the entire U.S. military: Thanks to this man's influence, the military is better prepared to fight using a comprehensive blend of civil-military activities. As America surveys a decade of untraditional warfare, this much is clear: The career of General David Petraeus profoundly shaped our military and left an indelible mark on its rising leaders.</p></p><p><b>Paula Broadwell</b> served in the military for over a decade and has more than fifteen years experience in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency.

Except he wasn't her problem.</p><p>Blindly, she turned her attention back toward Rose's Cafe, her stomach tight with nausea, as if she'd been sucker punched.</p><p>Katie wouldn't be heading off to her sophomore year at college in the fall, or hanging around with undesirable boys. Katie was dead.</p><p>Murdered.</p><p>Logically, she knew her younger sister was gone. Yet in that one brief moment when she'd imagined she'd heard Katie calling her name, she'd wanted so badly to believe Katie's death was nothing more than a horrible nightmare.</p><p>But it wasn't. Katie was gone.</p><p>Her church pastor tried to tell her Katie was in a much better place, but she didn't buy that theory. The real question was why hadn't God stopped her sweet sister from being murdered? Why hadn't he taken her, instead?</p><p>Desperately trying to get a grip on her rioting emotions, she paused outside Rose's Cafe and glanced once again toward the Gas N Go station, where the black car had pulled in. There was no sign of the vehicle now. With a frown, she scanned the entire area, including the various businesses.</p><p>The black sedan had disappeared.</p><p>Or she'd imagined the whole thing, just like she'd imagined she'd heard Katie.</p><p>Exhausted and shaken, Megan slumped against the building, putting a hand to her throbbing head, and swallowed hard against another wave of nausea. No. No way. I absolutely refuse to be crazy.</p><p>You refuse, huh? A tall man stepped forward, blocking her view of the sun. He stood with his arms crossed over his uniformed chest, looking down at her with an arched brow. So how's that working for</p><p>you?</p><p>She grimaced, realizing she'd spoken out loud. Wasn't it true that insane people didn't believe they were crazy? Shaking off the bitter fear that plagued her, Megan straightened and belatedly noticed the crisp tan uniform along with the shiny badge pinned to the stranger's chest.</p><p>A cop. Great. This was not what she needed in the middle of her nervous breakdown. She strove for a light tone. So far, it's working fine, thanks. Excuse me. She ducked past him, seeking refuge in Rose's Cafe.</p><p>She slid onto the only vacant stool at the counter, figuring she wouldn't be there long. The main reason she'd come at all was to get a good look at the guy driving the black car.</p><p>What can I get for you, sweetie? Josie, the middle-aged waitress, called all her customers sweetie. Megan suspected Josie thought the term was easier than trying to remember so many names, especially in the height of the tourist season.</p><p>A cup of coffee, please. She glanced back in time to see that the cop who'd followed her into the diner had joined another officer in one of the booths that lined the</p><p>wall. She turned her attention back to Josie. She wasn't paranoid enough to think he'd followed her inside to keep an eye on her. Cops had to eat too. Cream, no sugar.</p><p>Is that all? Josie arched an exasperated brow, propping a hand on her plump hip. Sweetie, you picked the middle of the lunch rush to order a measly cup of</p><p>coffee?</p><p>Josie obviously wasn't pleased she'd taken a seat that an otherwise paying customer may have occupied. Since Megan wasn't sure her legs could hold her weight if she left, she tried to recall the menu. Ah, I almost forgot. I'll take a grilled chicken sandwich too.</p><p>Coming right up. Josie poured her coffee, pushed a container of cream at her, and then disappeared to give her order to the cook.</p><p>Megan sipped her coffee, trying not to notice how several of the locals stared at her with obvious suspicion. Since she'd taken over her aunt's property, a small cabin on the north shore of Crystal Lake, her status was barely one step above the tourists, but not by much. She'd moved here from Chicago, and people in the town of Crystal Lake, Wisconsin, seemed to carry a grudge against people from Illinois. She should be used to the sensation of being the unwelcome newcomer by now.</p><p>Crystal Lake wasn't a large town, but it was right in the middle of Hope County, which made it the hub of all county activities. The courthouse, the post office and the sheriff's department headquarters, to name a few. Her tiny log cabin was located ten miles outside of town on a very deserted road with an awesome view of the lake, nice and private, the way she preferred. So what if the</p><p>general population of Crystal Lake considered her little more than a weird hermit? She didn't care.</p><p>Except when she was being followed.</p><p>She turned her head to peek at the pair of cops seated behind her. The taller of the two had impossibly broad shoulders and black hair kept military-short, which did nothing to soften his broad, rugged features. His square jaw was strong and firm, but his nose looked as if it may have been broken at one point. He had dark eyes and tanned skin that made his teeth look shockingly white when he smiled. He was definitely attractive, if you appreciated a tall man in uniform. Since the other cop was much older and shorter and had a slight paunch around his middle, she knew it was the taller man who'd overheard her talking to herself outside. With the sun glare in her eyes, she hadn't gotten a very good look at him.</p><p>What would he say if she went over to announce she thought she was being followed? Probably not much, since she'd also practically told him she was insane.</p><p><i>So how's that working for you?</i></p><p>Her cheeks burned and she ducked her head, deciding not to bother. There was no point when she hadn't even managed to get a simple license plate number. Once she had something solid to give them, she'd go to the authorities.</p><p>She took another sip of her coffee, reveling in the warmth of the mug despite the sunny day outside. A group from the back of the diner passed behind her on their way out. An elbow hit her hard in the back, causing her to spill her coffee down the front of her green blouse.</p><p>'Scuse me, a gruff male voice muttered as the group</p><p>left.</p><p>She clenched her teeth against a wave of annoyance</p><p>and dabbed at the stain. A moment later, Josie set her chicken sandwich in front of her.</p><p>Need anything else, sweetie? Josie asked, automatically refilling her coffee cup.</p><p>No, thanks. She forced a smile and gave up on her blouse. Josie slapped her bill upside down next to her plate and sashayed away to attend to her other customers.</p><p>She didn't want to believe the jab to her back had been done on purpose, but she couldn't help but think so. Why she'd become a target, she had no idea. She wasn't hurting anyone. She wasn't even in town very often. She was either in her cabin or working her part-time and rather mundane job of processing DNA samples at the State Crime Lab in Madison.</p><p>Obviously, her level of paranoia was already several standard deviations from the mean. Picking at her chicken sandwich, she took only a few bites before pushing her plate away.</p><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder.

Until now, few have understood how close this breach was to becoming a permanent fixture on the map of history. It was the nation&#39;s, and Mr. Lincoln&#39;s, most trying month, as Gen. Robert E. Lee invaded Union soil, panicking entire cities, destroying fragile political alliances and causing all of the North to rethink the fight and question whether it was best to redouble its war efforts or give up and let the South pursue its own course. For three weeks in September, the air was electric, nerves were at the breaking point and the whole of the North held its breath. In this fascinating work, Dennis Frye draws from a voluminous cache of period newspapers to expertly demonstrate just how fragile the national bond had become by the autumn of 1862.</p><p>Dennis E. Frye is the Chief Historian at Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. In demand as a writer, lecturer, guide, and preservationist, he has appeared numerous times on PBS, The History Channel, The Discovery Channel, and A&amp;E as a guest historian. He has helped produce award-winning television features on the Battle of Antietam and abolitionist John Brown. A prolific author with over 77 articles and seven books to his credit, his most recent book prior to <i>September Suspense </i>is <i>Harpers Ferry Under Fire: A Border Town in the America Civil War</i>. Dennis resides near the Antietam Battlefield in Maryland, where he and his wife Sylvia have restored the home that was used by General Ambrose Burnside as his post-Antietam headquarters.</p><h2>Squiggly Wiggly&#39;s Surprise: A Finger Puppet Learns About Colors (A PSS Surprise!

Here&#x2019;s one that does. Written by professional woodworker Marilyn MacEwen, it gives women the skills and confidence to enter this traditionally masculine preserve, from mastering complex techniques to handling advanced projects. In detail, MacEwen covers wood types and their characteristics, shows how to set up an efficient workshop, discusses and demystifies tools, explains how to read woodworking plans, and offers 16 practical and great-looking items to make, including a bed, chair, CD cabinet, and dining room table. Plus, there are invaluable tips on the ergonomics of working with wood with a woman&#x2019;s physique, and how to deal with the macho culture of the lumberyard.<br></p><p>Well aware of how intimidating woodworking can be for most women, MacEwen, a veteran craftsperson, has created a guide for women that addresses with sensitivity the psycho-emotional fears women have about working with wood. From tools to materials to entering a realm dominated by men, the book teaches women to think like woodworkers. The projects are presented to build confidence as well as skills. And MacEwen's mantra, "Mistakes are just information," is repeated and reinforced throughout the book. Pieces like the low bench, designed for use in woodworking, give women experience using the tools and creating a large piece of furniture without the anxiety of mistakes ruining the finished piece. Women inspired by the female carpenters on such shows as <i>Trading Spaces</i> or <i>While You Were Out</i> will be excited to discover this straightforward guide to woodworking, furniture design, and building. <i>Jennifer Palmer</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I was with Alan, per usual. We had fallen down the YouTube rabbit hole, which was a thing we did from time to time. Generally speaking, I hate YouTube, mostly because Alan is all, <i>I just have to show you this </i>one <i>thing, yo, </i>but in�evitably one thing becomes seventeen things, and before I know it, I&#x2019;m watching a sea otter operate a vending machine, thinking, <i>Where the fuck did I go wrong? </i>And look: I am not immune to the allure of the sea otter, but at a certain point a guy has to wonder about all the life decisions he&#x2019;s made that have landed him on a couch, watching a glorified weasel press H9 for a bag of SunChips.<br> &nbsp;<br> Quiet, and a little sad, but in a real way, drifting through the Rosa-Haas pool&#x2014;I fucking love it here.<br> &nbsp;<br> I would live here.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the sake of precision: the Fading Girl video is a rapid time-lapse compilation of photographs clocking in at just over twelve minutes. It&#x2019;s entitled <i>One Face, Forty Years: An Examination of the Aging Process</i>, and underneath it a cap�tion reads: &#x201c;Daily self-portraits from 1977 to 2015. I got tired.&#x201d; (I love that last part, as if the Fading Girl felt the need to explain why she hadn&#x2019;t quite made it the full forty years<i>.</i>) In the beginning, she&#x2019;s probably in her early twenties, with blonde hair, long and shimmery, and bright eyes like a sun�rise through a waterfall. At about the halfway mark the room changes, which I can only assume means she moved, but in the background, her possessions remain the same: a framed watercolor of mountains, a porcelain Chewbacca figurine, and elephants everywhere. Statues, posters, T-shirts&#x2014;the Fading Girl had an elephant obsession, safe to say. She&#x2019;s al�ways indoors, always alone, and&#x2014;other than the move, and a variety of haircuts&#x2014;she looks the same in every photo: no smile, staring straight into the camera, <i>every day for forty years. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Always the same, until: changes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Okay, I have to breathe now. <br> &nbsp;<br> I love this moment: breaking the surface, inhale, wet hair in the hot sun. <br> &nbsp;<br> Alan is all, &#x201c;Dude.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The moment would be better alone, to be honest. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That was like a record,&#x201d; says Val. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> A few more deep breaths, a quick smile, and . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> I love this moment even more: dipping beneath the sur�face. Something about being underwater allows me to feel at a higher capacity&#x2014;the silence and weightlessness, I think. <br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s my favorite thing about swimming. <br> &nbsp;<br> The earlier shots are scanned-in Polaroids, but as the time lapse progresses and the resolution of the photos increases, the brightness of the Fading Girl begins to diminish: little by little, the hair thins; little by little, the eyes dim; little by little, the face withers, the skin droops, the bright young wa�terfall becomes a darkened millpond, one more victim in the septic tank of aging. And it doesn&#x2019;t make me sad so much as leave an impression of sadness, like watching a stone sink but never hit bottom. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Every day for forty years. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;ve watched the video hundreds of times now: at night before bed, in the morning before school, in the library dur�ing lunch, on my phone during class, in my head during the in-betweens, I hum the Fading Girl like a song over and over again, and every time it ends I swear I&#x2019;ll never watch it again. But like the saddest human boomerang, I always come back. <br> &nbsp;<br> Twelve minutes of staring at your screen and watching a person die. It&#x2019;s not violent. It&#x2019;s not immoral or shameful; nothing is done to her that isn&#x2019;t done to all of us, in turn. It&#x2019;s called <i>An Examination of the Aging Process</i>, but I call bullshit. That girl isn&#x2019;t aging; she&#x2019;s fading. And I can&#x2019;t look away. <br> &nbsp;<br> There it is, the inevitable shoulder tap. <br> &nbsp;<br> Time to join the land of the breathing.</p><h2>Magical Secrets About Line Etching &amp; Engraving: The Step-by-Step Art of Incised Lines</h2><p>Cultural Writing. Art. Magical Secrets are sudden flashes of insight that help you make sense of something you care about. If you care about etching, engraving, and drypoint (a form of engraving), you will find revelations here. Author Catherine Brooks is a master printer at Crown Point Press, printers and publishers of etchings since 1962, and she draws on the venerable history of that institution to create an inspirational and highly usable how-to book. Crown Point Press founder, Kathan Brown, adds an appendix on hand-wiping and printing that teaches you to ink and print etchings with Crown Point&#39;s superlative quality. The practical information is artist-centered, with illustrations and discussions of line etchings and engravings enhanced by quotations from the artists who made them. The book includes a DVD on which Catherine Brooks and Kathan Brown demonstrate the processes and artists are shown using them.</p><p>This book gives readily accessible information on all forms of intaglio line, from drypoint and engraving to wax-based hard and soft grounds. Health and safety is addressed where necessary. Wonderfully illustrated with step-by-step photographs of the processes, the book includes works by more than 20 artists including Chuck Close, Anish Kapoor and Judy Pfaff. The accompanying DVD provides another route of access, ideal for those who may be intimidated by the written word. Kathan Brown&#39;s appendix on printing is well laid-out with diagrams and photographs. Interestingly it does not follow the ways of printing often found in the US but describes the Crown Point Press way that she learned while studying at London&#39;s Central School of Art. It is extremely refreshing to see such clear explanation of traditional methods. ----Alan Smith, Etching Instructor- Royal College of Art, London, Printmaking Today, 2008</p><h2>A Fool&#39;s Gold Christmas (Fool&#39;s Gold, 13)</h2><p>The unrelenting cheer in Fool's Gold, California, is bringing out the humbug in dancer Evie Stryker.

He relieves his pent-up frustrations by lighting matches. His only friend, Joel, who owes money to some drug dealers, is shutting him out, too. When he angers two popular girls, Emma and Abby, they plot to get revenge. What begins as a game for Abby changes when she begins to care for Cal. He thinks she's just messing with him and he begins to freak out and starts setting more than just matches on fire. Believing he has no options, he plans to go out in a blaze of glory by helping Joel get rid of the drug dealers. Abby and an arson investigator save him from destroying himself and others. His feelings of alienation and inadequacy are believably portrayed in this absorbing, fast-paced novel set in England; resorting to destructive acts without regard for others or the consequences is an all-too-realistic response in today's society. However, the fact that Cal is caught by a detective who lets him go scot-free because he reminds the man of his dead son is unbelievable. Readers are led to believe that the enormity of what could have happened has cured Cal of his pyromaniac tendencies. The portrayal of the club scenes with the emphasis on drinking and drugs makes this book more appropriate for older teens. -Sharon Rawlins, Piscataway Public Library, NJ <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.A pyromaniac makes for an unusual protagonist in this provocative first novel, but the plot unfolds too slowly, and the characters' actions are often unconvincing. Not only is 11th grader Cal painfully shy and filled with self-loathing, but the only thing that makes him feel better is setting bigger and bigger fires. When two popular girls, Emma and Abby, make him a target for cruelty and his only friend, Joel, gets in trouble with the drug dealers for whom Joel was selling, the tension mounts. Cal makes a deadly plan to ensure "none of you are gonna be able to hurt me anymore"; and the people who care about him, including Abby (who develops an affection for him) and a distraught detective who's on his case, must try to save him. Wooding tackles British youth culture with mixed results (for example, the club settings seem authentic, but some of the dialogue feels forced). The majority of the third-person narrative takes Cal's point of view, but occasionally slips awkwardly and abruptly into other characters' (e.g., when Emma stalks Cal at a club; when a bum sees Cal light a factory on fire; when the detective reflects on his own son). Most importantly, readers may find it hard to believe that evil Emma would really go after Cal, or that the detective would, in the end, decide to let him go.

It is dry farm country, this valley: mainly cotton, olives, almonds, pecans, pistachios, occasionally a patch of corn, but still the richest agricultural land in the nation. The fields reel away from the roadside, receding into the hot, hazy distance&#x2014;the gray-greens of miles upon miles of neatly planted olive groves, the brighter green of the nut trees, yellowed grass of an endless plain of pasturage, broken only occasionally by a battered wooden barn or shed, an occasional turn-of-the century farmhouse set off by a stout and rounded palm, planted when Roosevelt&#x2014;Teddy that is&#x2014;was president.In the distance to the east rises the rampart of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, vaguely bluish in the haze, but promising the cooler climes of higher elevation, and offering its life-giving supply of cold ice-melt water rushing down from its canyons&#x2014;the Kern, the Tulare, the San Joaquin, the King.Before the highway, of course, was the railroad; and it is to Leland Stanford and the Southern Pacific that the city of Fresno owes its existence. In 1872, Stanford, a former California governor and founder of the transcontinental railroad that eventually evolved into the Southern Pacific&#x2014;&#x201c;the Octopus,&#x201d; as it was later called by social reformers&#x2014;was making a trip through the southeastern part of the vast San Joaquin Valley when he came upon nearly two thousand acres planted in ripe, golden wheat, and watered by the precious Sierra snowmelt. Here, Stanford decided, was the ideal route for his railroad&#x2019;s line south to Los Angeles and the vast markets he envisioned for that city&#x2019;s future.In those days, the county seat was in Millerton, some miles to the northeast. Fresno County, as it was called for the Spanish word for ash tree, was a dry, desert region of low watercourses lined by the ubiquitous ash and willow, along with plains of yellowed grass, punctuated by patches of prickly pear. In summer the heat was searing, while in winter, the fog lay cold and clammy, close to the earth; the region had first been populated by native Americans, then a scattering of Mexicans, who gave way to immigrants from Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri as the Civil War came on. By the time Stanford reached the area, the sympathizers of Stars and Bars were in the majority.Stanford laid his tracks in a southeasterly direction, and eventually the line extended south through the town of Tulare, all the way to Bakersfield, one hundred miles from Fresno. By the late 1870s the line had punched all the way through the Tehachapi Mountains into Los Angeles, and a shipping dynasty was born.The Southern Pacific dominated Fresno, as it did much of the Central Valley; it was Stanford&#x2019;s genius, as well as his fault, to see the great valley as the realm of riches it eventually became, and to desire to rule its affairs completely. A glance at the map of Fresno tells the story: the tracks run southeast, and the streets of the oldest part of the town are canted in a southwest to northeast direction; in order words, to serve the rail line. It was only later, as Fresno began to grow larger than the rail depot that Stanford envisioned, that the streets surrounding the old town were platted on north-south and east-west directions.Drawn by the fertile soil and the land sales promotions of the railroad, augmented by irrigation ditches and canals, Fresno grew steadily throughout the rest of the nineteenth century. By the early 1920s, the town was a peculiar ethnic mix of Hispanics, blacks, the descendants of the white southern immigrants, and a large influx of Armenians, many of whom came after the massacre in Turkey during World War I.Then came the Depression, and the Dustbowl years; tens of thousands of small farmers from Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas, their futures blighted by drought and wind and unforgiving banks and drawn by stories told by their relatives, the descendants of the nineteenth-century southern influx, packed all their belongings into trucks and Model Ts and headed west, just as John Steinbeck recorded in <i>The Grapes of Wrath.</i>And after the Depression came the war, with the high demand for cotton and foodstuffs; Fresno prospered once more, so that by the 1950s, the area around the growing city was a unique mix more akin to what one might find in New Mexico or Texas or Oklahoma than anywhere else in California. The trains rolled in, the trains rolled out; Dwight Eisenhower&#x2019;s interstate highway system improved the long highway known as Ninety-nine, and thousands of new arrivals came to try their hand at working the land, and working those who worked the land&#x2014;among the latter, a tall, handsome, fiercely ambitious young man named Dale Ewell.<br><br>Dale Ewell was a child of the Depression. Born in the fall of 1932, the first of four sons of Ohio farmer Austin Ewell and his Kansas-born wife Mary, Dale was taught from his earliest years to expect nothing but hard work, to regard other men with suspicion; to expect no quarter, and to give none. There was no silver spoon in Dale Ewell&#x2019;s mouth when he was born, in that year of midwestern dust storms, Herbert Hoover, and collapsing farm prices; or for that matter, no bed of roses for his older sister Betty, or his younger twin brothers Richard and Dan, or Ben, the baby of the family.Austin Ewell worked his two hundred acres in oats, soybeans, corn, and a little wheat, along with cattle, chickens, and hogs. Everyone worked, because, to the Ewell family, that&#x2019;s what life was: work. The way Betty remembered it, years later, the family always had enough to eat; it was money that was scarce.Some said all the Ewell boys grew up hard-hearted, competitive, and, others said, controlling; it was the way Austin had raised them. Certainly they were all intensely ambitious. And, some whispered, there was no stopping a Ewell, neither law nor morality, when he fixed his eyes on something he wanted, or thought he was entitled to.Once a man, an acquaintance of Dale Ewell, traveled to Ohio to visit the patriarch, Austin. On the way there, the visitor got lost, and found his way to an American Legion Hall, thinking to quench his thirst with a beer and ask for directions.&#x201c;What do you want to see <i>him</i> for?&#x201d; the visitor was asked.And when the visitor explained his errand, the local pulled a face.&#x201c;Old Ewell is a mean, nasty old man who doesn&#x2019;t care about anybody but himself,&#x201d; the local said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you what I mean. I sharpen saws for a living. One day old Ewell come to me with a saw to sharpen. Now, ordinarily my price is seven dollars. But old Ewell says, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll pay you five, and not a penny more.&#x2019; So I say, all right, and I agree to do her for five.&#x201c;Then, wouldn&#x2019;t you know it, the next week, old Ewell shows up again, and he&#x2019;s got a saw with him. He&#x2019;s complaining the work wasn&#x2019;t done right, and now he wants me to do it over, for free! And do you know what? When I looked at that saw, why it was a completely different saw! It was the same kind, all right, but a completely different one. Old Ewell, he wanted me to sharpen that second saw for free, and was trying to trick me into it. All for five dollars. Can you imagine that?&#x201d;These were the values imparted to his sons by Austin Ewell: abiding respect for the dollar, the appreciation of sweat and hard work, the belief that the other man was not to be trusted any more than the other man should trust you: that is, if he was so stupid you could put one over on him, you should do it. Most of all, though, there was the sense of two worlds&#x2014;the world of hearth and kin, where one set of values obtained, and the world of the outside, where dogs ate dogs and only fools thought different.<br><br>As a youngster growing up on a small farm in northern Ohio, Dale Ewell&#x2019;s earliest years were circumscribed by the rhythms of the soil&#x2014;planting in the spring, harvesting in the fall, the ingrained knowledge that for everything there is a season, and a natural order. Dale Ewell knew what it was like to get up early, and what it was like to strain his muscles until he was bone-tired, how to sweat until dry. That&#x2019;s the way the world was and the way it always would be, Austin Ewell assured him. But young Dale, when he had the chance, liked to look up from time to time from the endless rows of corn to see the sky; and what he saw there was the beauty and the precision of flight.By the time he was ten, the world was at war: a global war in which victory would go to the nation with the strongest air power. All over the country, defense plants running round-the-clock turned out engines, fuselages, Plexiglas for windscreens, rivets for airframes, lightweight alloys for hydraulic lines, synthetic rubber for aircraft tires. The skies were filled with flying machines, from the large four-engined bombers to the high-performance fighter aircraft, along with scores of other fabrications&#x2014;transport aircraft, gliders, observation planes, long-range reconnaissance configurations&#x2014;each of them more varied, more powerful, more amazing than the last. It was the Golden Age of flight, powered irreducibly by the demands of war. And it was the beginning of a vast industry in which a smart man, if he worked hard, might never have to pick an ear of corn again.In the fall of 1950, young Dale, then 18 years old, left home for the first time. He enrolled at Miami University of Ohio, in Oxford, where he majored in aeronautical engineering. Dale had his future planned out: first he&#x2019;d get his engineering degree, his ticket to the glorious age then dawning; then he&#x2019;d join the United States Air Force and learn how to fly. When that was done, he&#x2019;d head out to California and go to work in the burgeoning aircraft industry, where jobs were plentiful and the pay was great. After that, who knew? But Dale knew one thing: the airplane business was a long way away from a small Ohio farm; even better, it came with a regular paycheck, and if there was one thing Dale wanted after those Depression years feeding chickens, it was money, and not chicken feed, either.Graduating on schedule, Dale embarked on phase two of his long-range plan, joining the Air Force in 1954 just after the hostilities ended in Korea. Soon Dale had his wish: the Air Force taught him how to fly. Apparently, Dale was pretty good at it, because the Air Force assigned Dale to pilot a King Air, a twin-engined executive turboprop that then represented the top-of-the-line transportation for Air Force brass. Flying out of Sacramento and later Phoenix, Dale was able to meet many of the Air Force&#x2019;s top generals.It was in Tucson in 1957 that Dale met a pretty, vivacious University of Arizona student named Glee Ethel Mitchell, the only child of a relatively wealthy Chicago family with roots (and royalties) from the Oklahoma oil fields. Dale and Glee (who had the same first name as her mother, Glee Irvin Mitchell) were a contrasting pair. Where Dale was often taciturn, sometimes even monosyllabic to the point of rudeness, Glee was soft-spoken, open, and socially adept. Some thought Dale was simply shy, acutely aware of the social differences between his rural Ohio roots and Glee&#x2019;s more urbane family. Glee&#x2019;s people had money; Dale&#x2019;s did not.Glee&#x2019;s mother, Glee Irvin Mitchell, was one of three daughters born to an Oklahoma country doctor, G. E. Irvin. Dr. Irvin was both shrewd and fortunate. It seemed to some that he had a nose for oil. Settling down in Gage, a small town in the western reaches of Oklahoma not far from the Texas border, Dr. Irvin soon began buying real estate and oil leases. By the 1920s, Dr. Irvin was a wealthy man, and by the time of his death, the Irvin family owned land in five different states, including Texas, Missouri, Mississippi, and Arkansas, in addition to Oklahoma. A great many of these parcels held producing oil wells.When Dr. Irvin died, all three daughters, Glee, Helen, and Grace, managed the real estate and oil properties as a family enterprise, sharing the revenues more or less equally between them.By that time, Glee Irvin had become Glee Mitchell, married to a man who was an instructor at a Chicago athletic club. When Glee Mitchell gave birth to her own daughter and named her Glee Ethel, the rest of the family began to distinguish mother and daughter by the affectionate nicknames of Big Glee and Little Glee.Little Glee grew quite close to her Oklahoma relatives, spending each summer in Gage, and once spending an entire year there. A brilliant student, Little Glee&#x2019;s great ambition was to travel the world.&#x201c;Her goal in life was to go around the world,&#x201d; her cousin, Jimmie Glee Thurmond, recalled later. &#x201c;She was the kind of person who wanted to see and do everything.&#x201d;In 1953, Glee enrolled at the University of Arizona, majoring in Inter-American studies, and took a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in 1957, while winning Phi Beta Kappa honors.Late that same year, Dale got out of the Air Force, and got a job with Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach, California. Meanwhile, Glee continued her graduate studies at the University of Arizona.Whether Dale wanted to marry Glee as soon as she finished her studies isn&#x2019;t clear; what is clear is that Glee had a lifelong interest in travel and meeting people from other cultures, unlike Dale. In any event, in 1959 Glee joined the Central Intelligence Agency.In later years, this comparatively brief employment with the nation&#x2019;s shadowy foreign intelligence agency&#x2014;as a translator in Argentina, some said&#x2014;was seen by some as possibly suggestive of a deeper side to Glee&#x2019;s nature, and possibly as a motive for her murder, however unlikely such a scenario.After two years in Argentina, Glee resigned and returned to the United States. On December 28, 1961, Dale and Glee were married.By then Dale had decided that Douglas Aircraft was perhaps a bit too bureaucratic for someone with his ambitions. And Dale had discovered something else, from his years in the Air Force: he enjoyed flying the airplanes more, much more, than he enjoyed engineering them.In 1959, that in turn led Dale to Fresno, where he soon found a job selling Cessna airplanes&#x2014;many of them to farmers.This was something that Dale Ewell was born to do, the perfect amalgamation of his own farming background with his love of flying. Even better, the commissions on the sales of the airplanes were substantial&#x2014;an order of magnitude above what a salesman might earn for peddling a new car.Best of all, Dale Ewell knew his customers. Many were variations of his father, Austin. Dale knew how to talk the farm talk, knew the margins of the farm business. He knew about crops and markets and irrigation and water and livestock&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t he grown up with his own feet in the dirt?The Ewell sales approach was unique. Dale wouldn&#x2019;t wait until a customer suddenly decided he or she wanted to own an airplane. If he waited for that to happen, he&#x2019;d starve to death. No, Dale took the airplane to the customer. He&#x2019;d land on a farmer&#x2019;s empty field or an isola...</p><h2>Luther and the Mystics: A re-examination of Luther&#39;s spiritual experience and his relationship to the mystics</h2><p>From the dust jacket: &#34;The theology of Martin Luther includes both an external, objective emphasis and an internal, subjective emphasis. Luther studies have paid close attention to the former with its well-known phrases: &#39;Christ for us,&#39; &#39;righteousness outside us,&#39; and &#39;external Word.&#39; But for some reason the subjective or mystical element in Luther&#39;s thought has been practically ignored. Prof. Hoffman reminds us of this important aspect in Luther and shows its significance in Luther&#39;s theology as a whole. It is true that Luther rejected all schemes of salvation, mystical or otherwise, that did not have Christ at the center. He insisted that the Gospel be anchored in history and Scripture. Yet he did not neglect the personal, non-rational aspects of fatih. He spoke of &#39;the kingdom within us&#39; and of our &#39;mystical union&#39; with Christ. Those who attempt to interpret Luther must study both the objective and the subjective elements in his theology. And they must not forget that Luther himself had a life-long appreciation of such mystics as Bernard of Clairvaux, Johan Tauler, and the unknown author of Theologia Germanica.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Great Ideas an Apology for Idlers (Penguin Great Ideas)</h2><p>An irresistible invitation to reject the work ethic and enjoy life&#39;s simple pleasures (such as laughing, drinking and lying in the open air), Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s witty and seminal essay on the joys of idleness is accompanied here by his writings on, among other things, growing old, visiting unpleasant places and the overwhelming experience of falling in love. Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are</p><p>Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh in 1850. The son of a prosperous civil engineer, he was expected to follow the family profession but was finally allowed to study law at Edinburgh University. Stevenson reacted forcibly against the Presbyterianism of both his city&#39;s professional classes and his devout parents, but the influence of Calvinism on his childhood informed the fascination with evil that is so powerfully explored in Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Stevenson suffered from a severe respiratory disease from his twenties onwards, leading him to settle in the gentle climate of Samoa with his American wife, Fanny Osbourne.</p><h2>The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon</h2><p>&#39;The world had teeth and it could bite you with them anytime it wanted. Trisha McFarland discovered this when she was nine years old. Trying not to be terrified. Trying not to think that sometimes when people got lost in the woods they got seriously hurt. Sometimes they died.&#39; In Trisha&#39;s panic to get back on the track, she takes turnings which lead her deeper and deeper into the woods. With only a small amount of food and water in her knapsack, she begins to give up hope of ever getting out. Alive. The only thing that keeps her going is her Walkman on which she listens avidly to Red Sox baseball games, creating an imaginary friendship with her hero Tom Gordon. And as she struggles for survival and a way out, she realises she&#39;s not alone. There&#39;s something else in the woods - and it&#39;s watching her...</p><p>With a convincing mix of youthful optimism and world-weary resignation, reader Anne Heche adds resonance to this unabridged recording. Heche is especially effective as the 9-year-old heroine, Trisha McFarland, who makes a fateful decision during an afternoon hike with her dysfunctional family. "The paths had forked in a 'Y.' She would simply walk across the gap and rejoin the main trail. Piece of cake. There was no chance of getting lost." As one might suspect, there is every chance she'll get lost--or worse--and taking the shortcut turns out to be a very bad choice indeed. At times Heche's reading may be too measured, but her narration is generally quite good and her steady portrayal of a young girl lost renders this tale all the more frightening. (Running time: 6.5 hours, 6 cassettes) <i>--George Laney</i>On a six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, nine-year-old Trisha McFarland quickly tires of the constant bickering between her older brother, Pete, and her recently divorced mother. But when she wanders off by herself, and then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror.<p>As night falls, Trisha has only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, and only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fears. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero, relief pitcher Tom Gordon. And when her radio's reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her -- protecting her from an all-too-real enemy who has left a trail of slaughtered animals and mangled trees in the dense, dark woods....</p></p><h2>The Women My Father Knew: A Novel (Karen and Michael Braziller Books)</h2><p><p><strong>A literary mystery, set in New York City and bohemian Tel Aviv, by one of Israel&#x2019;s most admired popular authors.</strong></p> After his successful first novel, Meir suffers writer&#x2019;s block.

Of course, back in her Bureau days, she&#x2019;d never even had an office---just a desk. Progress.<br><br>Budgets had grown, not due to tribal prosperity but because of an increase in violent crimes across the Navajo Nation. That had forced an expansion of their existing station and Ella, as head of their Major Crimes Unit, had landed space in their new wing. The odor of fresh paint was a constant reminder of the changes taking place in the department as was the color scheme, a palette of soft aquas, designed to relieve stress and maximize efficiency.<br><br>Ella swiveled in her chair, took a sip of freshly brewed coffee, and gazed at Ship Rock, the rock formation that was their town&#x2019;s namesake. In actuality, the jagged rock outcropping was the eroded neck of a volcano that had formed three million years ago.<br><br>Ella recalled the old story about the huge flying monsters that had once lived there. The tale was part of every Navajo child&#x2019;s education from before the first grade---that is, if they attended reservation schools. The story was vibrant with the richness and rhythms of the Dineh, The People&#x2019;s, legends. She could almost hear her mother, Rose, telling her the tale, keeping the legends alive---a gift from one generation to the next.<br><br>The Dineh had lived in fear of the giant birds who&#x2019;d made their home on the upper levels of Ship Rock, Rose had taught her. The birds would swoop down and smash their prey against the rocks, then feed on the remains. Monster Slayer, one of the Hero Twins, was chosen to do battle with them, but when he approached their hunting ground, one of the giant birds picked him up in his talons, flew high into the skies, and dropped him, leaving him to fall on the rocks below. Expecting nothing less, Monster Slayer had prepared well and landed gently because he&#x2019;d possessed a life feather given to him by Spider Woman.<br><br>Then Monster Slayer discovered that the giant birds had young and, after he killed the male and the female, the young began to cry and plead for their lives. Monster Slayer took pity on them and, instead of killing them, he turned the older one into an eagle so he could furnish feathers for men, and the younger one into an owl so men would listen to the owl&#x2019;s voice and be able to discern the future.<br><br>Rabbit, who was below, took some feathers from the giant bird Monster Slayer had killed and stuck them in his fur. And that&#x2019;s why jackrabbits have large ears that look like giant feathers.<br><br>All the Dinetah, the land of the Navajos, was filled with stories about the ones who&#x2019;d come before. Every sandstone formation, pass or valley, mountain peak, and rock formation within the Four Corners and beyond echoed with the tradition of the Dineh.<br><br>Ella sipped her coffee. It was still early, and she refused to rush as she made up for all those years of staring at painted cinder blocks and file cabinets instead of the blue sky and drifting white clouds. The wind was calm now, as it usually was during the early morning hours, and she intended to savor this moment of peace. By noon, or maybe even before, the gusts could start again, blowing sand and dust everywhere.<br><br>Gathering her thoughts, she watched the crows hop around the parking lot outside, looking for crumbs and candy wrappers that still held a hint of flavor. Just beyond them she could see two support posts of a control gate built into the bank of the irrigation ditch. Last night some would-be comedian had slipped an old pair of khaki uniform pants onto the posts, then placed shoes on the ends. At first glance it looked like an officer was headfirst in the ditch. Everyone who&#x2019;d driven past it on the way into the station had chuckled and commented about it, so it had remained in place for the moment. Later, the conservancy people would probably come by and return it to normal.<br><br>Finished with her coffee, she turned, hearing Justine step through the doorway. &#x201c;Morning, partner,&#x201c; Ella greeted.<br><br>Justine nodded, a somber expression on her face. &#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s good about it now. Another possible carjacking went down late last night or earlier this morning. This time all hell has broken loose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;ve we got?&#x201d; Ella said, automatically reaching for her keys as she dropped the empty foam cup into the wastebasket.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a homicide too---a soldier who just returned home from Iraq. The officer at the scene ID&#x2019;d him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d he die?&#x201d; Ella grabbed her jacket, and was out the door before Justine had answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Multiple gunshot wounds, according to the officer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have a &#x2018;twenty&#x2019; on this?&#x201d; she asked referring to the location of the crime as they hurried down the hall.<br><br>&#x201c;Just off Highway 64 about three miles west of Rattlesnake,&#x201c; Justine answered. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll have to take your unit. Mine&#x2019;s getting new tires.&#x201d;<br><br>Once in the parking lot, they hurried to Ella&#x2019;s unmarked vehicle, Justine taking the keys. As they pulled up to the highway and Justine braked, checking for traffic, they both heard an ominous high-pitched squeal. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the dust from yesterday&#x2019;s wind. Smell it in the air? It&#x2019;s starting early today too. The breeze will turn into gusts before noon today for sure and sand will fly everywhere including the brake linings again,&#x201c; Ella said. &#x201c;I read in the paper that the wind&#x2019;s been getting up to sixty in the afternoons. I hate this kind of weather. Waves and waves of sand, pitting the windshield, settling into the brake lines, even drifting into the gun barrels.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t do much for your mood, does it, partner?&#x201d; Justine observed with a wry smile.<br><br>&#x201c;No, it doesn&#x2019;t. I can&#x2019;t stand the constant whistling through the slightest gap in the windows and doors, the sand blasting against your skin... not to mention evidence flying everywhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some say that Wind carries information. You just have to listen carefully,&#x201c; Justine said.<br><br>&#x201c;Now you sound like my brother. Clifford knows all the stories. It&#x2019;s part of what makes him a good medicine man. He says that Wind has supporting power---that if I tune myself in to it, rather than become its adversary, I&#x2019;d get farther. But I still hate the taste of sand in my mouth, and since Wind puts it there...&#x201d;<br><br>Justine laughed.<br><br>Ella turned down the volume of the police radio. Today, it was mostly static and garbled transmissions. Another of Wind&#x2019;s side effects on obsolete equipment. The budget increases had targeted additional staff and facilities, not equipment, unfortunately. &#x201c;What else did you get on this latest crime?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Officer Mark Lujan called it in just a few minutes before I came into your office,&#x201c; Justine answered. &#x201c;He found the body down a side road near a cattle guard. It was visible from the highway. Most of the traffic this time of day goes toward town instead of away, so apparently nobody coming into work saw it across the road. Lujan was on his way west toward Beclabito.&#x201d;<br><br>Ella nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m familiar with that stretch. It&#x2019;s pretty desolate out there past Rattlesnake. Just a few houses here and there down toward the river, and you really have to look for them. Most are earth-toned and they blend into the landscape, except for the generic red tar paper roofs.&#x201d;<br><br>They made a sweeping turn toward the northwest, and Ella looked up at Ute Mountain over in Colorado. &#x201c;What do you have on the victim?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The deceased lived on land that was allotted to his family. After his parents passed on, he and his brother leased sections of it. The victim&#x2019;s name is Jimmy Blacksheep,&#x201c; she added after a moment&#x2019;s hesitation. Although police officers, by and large, were modernists, most of them shared a reluctance to speak of the recently deceased by name. It wasn&#x2019;t so much fear of the chindi, the evil in a man that stayed earthbound after death. It had more to do with respect for the Navajo cultural practices they&#x2019;d learned and followed most of their lives. Habits of a lifetime were hard to break.<br><br>&#x201c;Officer Lujan have any help at the scene?&#x201d; Ella asked, staring at the lonely stretch of highway before them.<br><br>&#x201c;No, but he&#x2019;s doing what he can to protect the crime scene until we arrive. Lujan&#x2019;s a rookie, but he&#x2019;s good. He&#x2019;ll handle things. And it&#x2019;s not like there&#x2019;s going to be a crowd there. Most of our people will go out of their way to avoid a body,&#x201c; Justine said then added. &#x201c;Tache, Neskahi, and the M.E. should arrive at the scene shortly.&#x201d;<br><br>Ella nodded. Sergeant Joseph Neskahi and Officer Ralph Tache worked for her Special Investigations team and served as the Crime Scene Unit. Carolyn Roanhorse was a forensic pathologist, an M.D. who specialized in causes of death that related to court proceedings. Carolyn understood bullet trajectories, poisonings, and could differentiate between stab wounds and blunt injury ones. There were less than one thousand forensic pathologists in the country, but Carolyn worked exclusively for the tribe---an exception to the otherwise statewide authority of the N.M. Office of the Medical Investigators, headquartered in Albuquerque.<br><br>Carolyn had a thankless job. Since she worked with the bodies of the dead, she was virtually a pariah but, through her work, she continued to acknowledge her debt to the tribe who&#x2019;d paid for her schooling.<br><br>As they approached the scene, Ella immediately spotte...</p></p><h2>Commonsense Handicapping: the Logical, Left-Brained Approach to Winning at the Races</h2><p>Commonsense Handicapping: the Logical, Left-Brained Approach to Winning at the Races, Hardcover Book Dick Mitchell.

He knows the stories that we need to sell the stuff tableside . . . he can disrupt the entire luxury foods market."<br> ---From the Foreword by David Chang</b><br><br> Ian Purkayastha is New York City's leading truffle importer and boasts a devoted clientele of top chefs nationwide, including Jean-Georges Vongerichten, David Chang, Sean Brock, and David Bouley. But before he was purveying the world's most expensive fungus to the country's most esteemed chefs, Ian was just a food-obsessed teenager in rural Arkansas--a misfit with a peculiar fascination for rare and exotic ingredients.<br><br> The son of an Indian immigrant father and a Texan mother, Ian learned to forage for wild mushrooms from an uncle in the Ozark hills. Thus began a single-track fixation that led him to learn about the prized but elusive truffle, the king of all fungi. His first taste of truffle at age 15 sparked his improbable yet remarkable adventure through the strange--and often corrupt--business of the exotic food trade.<br><br> Rife with tales from the hidden underbelly of the elite restaurant scene, <i>Truffle Boy </i>chronicles Ian's high stakes dealings with a truffle kingpin in Serbia, meth-head foragers in Oregon, crooked businessmen and maniacal chefs in Manhattan, gypsy truffle hunters in the forests of Hungary, and a supreme adventure to find "Gucci mushrooms" in the Himalayan foothills--the land of the gods. He endures harsh failures along the way but rebuilds with tremendous success by selling not just truffles but also caviar, wild mushrooms, rare foraged edibles, Wagyu beef, and other nearly unobtainable ingredients demanded by his Michelin-starred clients.<br><br> <i>Truffle Boy </i>is a thrilling coming-of-age story and the incredible but true tale of a country kid who grows up to become a force in the world of fine dining.<br></p><p><b>Ian Purkayastha </b>is the creator and owner of Regalis Foods and works with more than 300 of North America's finest chefs.

As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.When the expedition&#39;s leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape. The Terror swells with the heart-stopping suspense and heroic adventure that have won Dan Simmons praise as &#34;a writer who not only makes big promises but keeps them&#34; (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). With a haunting and constantly surprising story based on actual historical events, The Terror is a novel that will chill you to your core.</p><p><p><b>Dan Simmons </b>is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author whose work spans many genres, including science fiction, horror, historical fiction, and crime fiction. His books have been published in twenty-seven different countries. He has worked as a teacher in Missouri, New York, and Colorado. Many of Simmons' works have been optioned for film, including <i>Song of Kali, Drood, </i>and <i>The Crook Factory. </i>He lives in Colorado with his wife, Karen.</p>A blistering winter voyage, complete with scurvy, starvation, and thrilling adventure, is the focus of this powerful and beautifully realized tale of exploration on the high seas. Simmons's writing is so vivid that narrator Simon Vance need only deliver the material with a clear and firm reading to capture the interest of listeners. Vance does this so well that the presentation sounds like a recorded journal entry and captivates listeners from start to finish as he plays his role with the utmost respect for Simmons's work. The result is a moving listening experience--perfectly executed--which transports listeners to the galley of the HMS Terror during its expedition through the Arctic Circle. L.B.

So in Lee Child&#x2019;s electrifying new novel, Reacher&#x2014;a man with no fear, no illusions, and nothing to lose&#x2014;goes to war against a town that not only wants him gone, it wants him dead. <br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the welcome Reacher expected.

He was very weak. He had not eaten for seventy-two hours, or taken water for forty-eight.<br><br>Not weak. He was dying, and he knew it.<br><br>The images in his mind showed things drifting away. A rowboat caught in a river current, straining against a rotted rope, pulling, tugging, breaking free. His viewpoint was that of a small boy in the boat, sitting low, staring back helplessly at the bank as the dock grew smaller.<br><br>Or an airship swinging gently on a breeze, somehow breaking free of its mast, floating up and away, slowly, the boy inside seeing tiny urgent figures on the ground, waving, staring, their faces tilted upward in concern.<br><br>Then the images faded, because now words seemed more important than pictures, which was absurd, because he had never been interested in words before. But before he died he wanted to know which words were his. Which applied to him? Was he a man or a boy? He had been described both ways. <i>Be a man</i>, some had said. Others had been insistent: <i>The boy's not to blame</i>. He was old enough to vote and kill and die, which made him a man. He was too young to drink, even beer, which made him a boy. Was he brave, or a coward? He had been called both things. He had been called <i>unhinged, disturbed, deranged, unbalanced, delusional, traumatized</i>, all of which he understood and accepted, except <i>unhinged</i>. Was he supposed to be <i>hinged</i>? Like a door? Maybe people were doors. Maybe things passed through them. Maybe they banged in the wind. He considered the question for a long moment and then he batted the air in frustration. He was babbling like a teenager in love with weed.<br><br>Which is exactly all he had been, a year and a half before.<br><br>He fell to his knees. The sand was only half as hot as he had known sand to be, but it was hot enough to ease his chill. He fell facedown, exhausted, finally spent. He knew as certainly as he had ever known anything that if he closed his eyes he would never open them again.<br><br>But he was very tired.<br><br>So very, very tired.<br><br>More tired than a man or a boy had ever been.<br><br>He closed his eyes.<br><br><i>2</i><br>The line between Hope and Despair was exactly that: a line, in the road, formed where one town's blacktop finished and the other's started. Hope's highway department had used thick dark asphalt rolled smooth. Despair had a smaller municipal budget. That was clear. They had top-dressed a lumpy roadbed with hot tar and dumped gray gravel on it. Where the two surfaces met there was an inch-wide trench of no-man's-land filled with a black rubbery compound. An expansion joint. A boundary. A line. Jack Reacher stepped over it midstride and kept on walking. He paid it no attention at all.<br><br>But he remembered it later. Later, he was able to recall it in great detail.<br><br>Hope and Despair were both in Colorado. Reacher was in Colorado because two days previously he had been in Kansas, and Colorado was next to Kansas. He was making his way west and south. He had been in Calais, Maine, and had taken it into his head to cross the continent diagonally, all the way to San Diego in California. Calais was the last major place in the Northeast, San Diego was the last major place in the Southwest. One extreme to the other. The Atlantic to the Pacific, cool and damp to hot and dry. He took buses where there were any and hitched rides where there weren't. Where he couldn't find rides, he walked. He had arrived in Hope in the front passenger seat of a bottle-green Mercury Grand Marquis driven by a retired button salesman. He was on his way out of Hope on foot because that morning there had been no traffic heading west toward Despair.<br><br>He remembered that fact later, too. And wondered why he hadn't wondered why.<br><br>In terms of his grand diagonal design, he was slightly off course. Ideally he should have been angling directly southwest into New Mexico. But he wasn't a stickler for plans, and the Grand Marquis had been a comfortable car, and the old guy had been fixed on Hope because he had three grandchildren to see there, before heading onward to Denver to see four more. Reacher had listened patiently to the old guy's family tales and had figured that a saw-tooth itinerary first west and then south was entirely acceptable. Maybe two sides of a triangle would be more entertaining than one. And then in Hope he had looked at a map and seen Despair seventeen miles farther west and had been unable to resist the detour. Once or twice in his life he had made the same trip metaphorically. Now he figured he should make it for real, since the opportunity was right there in front of him.<br><br>He remembered that whim later, too.<br><br>The road between the two towns was a straight two-lane. It rose very gently as it headed west. Nothing dramatic. The part of eastern Colorado that Reacher was in was pretty flat. Like Kansas. But the Rockies were visible up ahead, blue and massive and hazy. They looked very close. Then suddenly they didn't. Reacher breasted a slight rise and stopped dead and understood why one town was called Hope and the other Despair. Settlers and homesteaders struggling west a hundred and fifty years before him would have stopped over in what came to be called Hope and would have seen their last great obstacle seemingly within touching distance. Then after a day's or a week's or a month's repose they would have moved on again and breasted the same slight rise and seen that the Rockies' apparent proximity had been nothing more than a cruel trick of topography. An optical illusion. A trick of the light. From the top of the rise the great barrier seemed once again remote, even unreachably distant, across hundreds more miles of endless plains. Maybe thousands more miles, although that too was an illusion. Reacher figured that in truth the first significant peaks were about two hundred miles away. A long month's hard trekking on foot and in mule-drawn carts, across featureless wilderness and along occasional decades-old wheel ruts. Maybe six weeks' hard trekking, in the wrong season. In context, not a disaster, but certainly a bitter disappointment, a blow hard enough to drive the anxious and the impatient from hope to despair in the time between one glance at the horizon and the next.<br><br>Reacher stepped off Despair's gritty road and walked through crusted sandy earth to a table rock the size of a car. He levered himself up and lay down with his hands behind his head and stared up at the sky. It was pale blue and laced with long high feathery clouds that might once have been vapor trails from coast-to-coast red-eye planes. Back when he smoked he might have lit a cigarette to pass the time. But he didn't smoke anymore. Smoking implied carrying at least a pack and a book of matches, and Reacher had long ago quit carrying things he didn't need. There was nothing in his pockets except paper money and an expired passport and an ATM card and a clip-together toothbrush. There was nothing waiting for him anywhere else, either. No storage unit in a distant city, nothing stashed with friends. He owned the things in his pockets and the clothes on his back and the shoes on his feet. That was all, and that was enough. Everything he needed, and nothing he didn't.<br><br>He got to his feet and stood on tiptoe, high on the rock. Behind him to the east was a shallow bowl maybe ten miles in diameter with the town of Hope roughly in its center, eight or nine miles back, maybe ten blocks by six of brick-built buildings and an outlying clutter of houses and farms and barns and other structures made of wood and corrugated metal. Together they made a warm low smudge in the haze. Ahead of him to the west were tens of thousands of flat square miles, completely empty except for ribbons of distant roads and the town of Despair about eight or nine miles ahead. Despair was harder to see than Hope. The haze was thicker in the west. The place looked larger than Hope had been, and teardrop-shaped, with a conventional plains downtown mostly south of the main drag and then a wider zone of activity beyond it, maybe industrial in nature, hence the smog. Despair looked less pleasant than Hope. Cold, where Hope had looked warm; gray, where Hope had been mellow. It looked unwelcoming. For a brief moment Reacher considered backtracking and striking out south from Hope itself, getting back on course, but he dismissed the thought even before it had fully formed. Reacher hated turning back. He liked to press on, dead ahead, whatever. Everyone's life needed an organizing principle, and relentless forward motion was Reacher's.<br><br>He was angry at himself later, for being so inflexible.<br><br>He climbed off the rock and rejoined the road twenty yards west of where he had left it. He stepped up onto the left-hand edge and continued walking, long strides, an easy pace, a little faster than three miles an hour, facing oncoming traffic, the safest way. But there was no oncoming traffic. No traffic in either direction. The road was deserted. No vehicles were using it. No cars, no trucks. Nothing. No chance of a ride. Reacher was a little puzzled, but mostly unconcerned. Many times in his life he had walked a lot more than seventeen miles at a stretch. He raked the hair off his forehead and pulled his shirt loose on his shoulders and kept on going, toward whatever lay ahead.<br><br><i>3</i><br>Despair's downtown area began with a vacant lot where something had been planned maybe twenty years before but never built. Then came an old motor court, shuttered, maybe permanently abandoned. Across the street and fifty yards west was a gas station. Two pumps, both of them old. Not the kind of upright rural antiques Reacher had seen in Edward Hopper's paintings, but still a couple of generations off the pace. There was a small hut in back with a grimy window full of quarts of oil arrayed in a pyramid. Reacher crossed the apron and stuck his head in the door. It was dark inside the hut and the air smelled of creosote and hot raw wood. There was a guy behind a counter, in worn blue overalls stained black with dirt. He was about thirty, and lean.<br><br>"Got coffee?" Reacher asked him.<br><br>"This is a gas station," the guy said.<br><br>"Gas stations sell coffee," Reacher said. "And water, and soda."<br><br>"Not this one," the guy said. "We sell gas."<br><br>"And oil."<br><br>"If you want it."<br><br>"Is there a coffee shop in town?"<br><br>"There's a restaurant."<br><br>"Just one?"<br><br>"One is all we need."<br><br>Reacher ducked back out to the daylight and kept on walking. A hundred yards farther west the road grew sidewalks and according to a sign on a pole changed its name to Main Street. Thirty feet later came the first developed block. It was occupied by a dour brick cube, three stories high, on the left side of the street, to the south. It might once have been a dry goods emporium. It was still some kind of a retail enterprise. Reacher could see three customers and bolts of cloth and plastic household items through its dusty groundfloor windows. Next to it was an identical three-story brick cube, and then another, and another. The downtown area seemed to be about twelve blocks square, bulked mostly to the south of Main Street. Reacher was no kind of an architectural expert, and he knew he was way west of the Mississippi, but the whole place gave him the feel of an old Connecticut factory town, or the Cincinnati riverfront. It was plain, and severe, and unadorned, and out of date. He had seen movies about small-town America in which the sets had been artfully dressed to look a little more perfect and vibrant than reality. This place was the exact opposite. It looked like a designer and a whole team of grips had worked hard to make it dowdier and gloomier than it needed to be. Traffic on the streets was light. Sedans and pick-up trucks were moving slow and lazy. None of them was newer than three years old. There were few pedestrians on the sidewalks.<br><br>Reacher made a random left turn and set about finding the promised restaurant. He quartered a dozen blocks and passed a grocery store and a barber shop and a bar and a rooming house and a faded old hotel before he found the eatery. It took up the whole ground floor of another dull brick cube. The ceiling was high and the windows were floor-to-ceiling plate glass items filling most of the walls. The place might have been an automobile showroom in the past. The floor was tiled and the tables and chairs were plain brown wood and the air smelled of boiled vegetables. There was a register station inside the door with a <i>Please Wait to Be Seated</i> sign on a short brassed pole with a heavy base. Same sign he had seen everywhere, coast to coast. Same script, same colors, same shape. He figured there was a catering supply company somewhere turning them out by the millions. He had seen identical signs in Calais, Maine, and expected to see more in San Diego, California. He stood next to the register and waited.<br><br>And waited.<br><br>There were eleven customers eating. Three couples, a threesome, and two singletons. One waitress. No front-of-house staff. Nobody at the register. Not an unusual ratio. Reacher had eaten in a thousand similar places and he knew the rhythm, subliminally. The lone waitress would soon glance over at him and nod, as if to say <i>I'll be right with you</i>. Then she would take an order, deliver a plate, and scoot over, maybe blowing an errant strand of hair off her cheek in a gesture designed to be both an apology and an appeal for sympathy. She would collect a menu from a stack and lead him to a table and bustle away and then revisit him in strict sequence.<br><br>But she didn't do any of that.<br><br>She glanced over. Didn't nod. Just looked at him for a long second and then looked away. Carried on with what she was doing. Which by that point wasn't much. She had all her eleven customers pacified. She was just making work. She was stopping by tables and asking if everything was all right and refilling coffee cups that were less than an inch down from the rim. Reacher turned and checked the door glass to see if he had missed an opening-hours sign. To see if the place was about to close up. It wasn't. He checked his reflection, to see if he was committing a social outrage with the way he was dressed. He wasn't. He was wearing dark gray pants and a matching dark gray shirt, both bought two days before in a janitorial surplus store in Kansas. Janitorial supply stores were his latest discovery. Plain, strong, well-made clothing at reasonable prices. Perfect. His hair was short and tidy. He had shaved the previous morning. His fly was zipped.</p><h2>Just the Facts: A Decade of Comic Essays</h2><p>With his inimitably idiosyncratic approach, David Collier tackles a broad range of subject matter in his first collection, from Thomas Edison's bygone phonograph machines to the lost art of hand-lettered display ads.

He teaches at Stanford University.Though fluent in a number of languages, Celan (1920-1970), who had come to Paris from Romanian Bukovina, pointedly wrote in German after WWII. His decomposition and recasting of that language, through a style that can seem dizzying in its complex poly-referentiality, was compounded by his erudition, by his own history as a Holocaust survivor whose parents were murdered in the camps, and finally by his suicide. For many, he one of the major poets of the 20th century. Though Celan's work presents obvious difficulties for any translator, his English-language readers have long been well-served by Michael Hamburger's starkly graceful selected translations (Poems of Paul Celan, Persea), which remain the best available, and more recently, by Pierre Joris's acute renderings of Celan's later work. Of the new collections here, the volume from Celan biographer and critic Felstiner is easily the most comprehensive, containing ample cullings from all of Celan's books, including many poems not included in Hamburger's selection, along with previously untranslated early and late work and four prose pieces. Felstiner handles these translations competently, rendering Celan in a somewhat more colloquial style than Hamburger or Joris. But his shifting diction (including "Thou") and his tendency to capitalize nouns and to let German words stand untranslated in the English text can make for a distracting admixture, as it does in Celan's much-anthologized early work, "Deathfugue": "Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night/ we drink you at midday Death is a master aus Deutschland." On the whole, Felstiner's efforts often pale beside those of Hamburger and Joris, but the page count of this dual-language collection will make it the default choice of those who will buy only one Celan volume. Popov and McHugh's collection also ranges over Celan's oeuvre, but far less comprehensively or successfully. Unlike Felstiner and Joris, Popov (The Russian People Speak: Democracy at the Crossroads) and poet McHugh (Father of the Predicaments, etc.) don't present the German texts en face, a practice they regard, in their preface, as a potential distraction from the reader's experience of their renderings. It would indeed be a distraction, making painfully clear just how far they depart from the originals to arrive at their idiosyncratic versions, which alter Celan's precise line and stanza lengths significantly, and forsake Celan's vertiginous difficulties for a more simplisticAsometimes macabre or wittyAstyle that's littered with heavy-handed gestures. One poem, for example, contains an ex nihilo insertion gleefully riffing on a German pun, others tip the scales of Celan's carefully weighted pronouns into one viewpoint or another. Even when hewing closer to the source text, Popov and McHugh incessantly heighten the poems' language, degrading their thorniness with more traditional sentiments. Fortunately, many of the poems translated by Popov and McHugh can be found in Joris's new volume, or in his 1995 rendering of Celan's Breathturn, both of which present entire books in razor-sharp, finely nuanced translations. Threadsuns represents the continuation of a marked turn in Celan's poeticsAaway from lusher effusions to intensely compressed, increasingly stark investigations of language, history and the poet's own capacities. Because much of this later work is serial in nature, Joris's decision to render the books in their entirety is profoundly important, and helps to make them necessary complements to Hamburger's selections. While it may not consistently attain the dazzling heights and depths of Celan's finest work in Breathturn and 1963's The No-One's Rose, Threadsuns contains an abundance of brilliant poems and provides ample evidence for the magnitude of Celan's stature in the last century, and in the one to come.

This text weaves together evocative descriptions, history and myth (including flowers and festivals) with his personal reminiscences.</p><p>Lawrence Durrell was born in 1912 in India. He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St Edmund&#39;s School, Canterbury. His first literary work, The Black Book, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, A Private Country, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: Prospero&#39;s Cell, Reflections on a Marine Venus, about Rhodes, and Bitter Lemons, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell&#39;s wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, The Alexandria Quartet, which he completed in southern France where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the Quartet and The Avignon Quintet he wrote the two-decker Tunc and Nunquam. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. Caesar&#39;s Vast Ghost, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, appeared a few days before his death in Sommieres in 1990.</p><h2>Personal Demon (Women of the Otherworld)</h2><p>In her acclaimed Women of the Otherworld series, Kelley Armstrong has created a scintillating realm where the supernatural and the human coexist on the edge of darkness, romance, and eternity.

But in addition to possessing the beauty of a Bollywood princess, Hope has other unique traits. For she is a half demon&#x2014;a human fathered by a demon. And she&#x2019;s inherited not only a gift for seeing the past but a hunger for chaos&#x2014;along with a talent for finding it wherever she can.

Now, as I shivered beside the cenotaph, knowing death was coming, what I felt was very different.<br><br>Only knowing it was too late to stop what was about to happen kept me from screaming a warning as I clutched the cold marble.<br><br>"Did you bring the money?" the first man asked, his voice tight with an anxiety that strummed through the air. He wore dress slacks an inch too long, hems pooling around scuffed department store loafers. His old leather jacket was done up against the bitter March night, but misbuttoned. I could picture his fingers trembling as he'd hurried out to this midnight meeting.<br><br>The other man was a decade older, his jogging suit hood pulled tight around his red-cheeked face. Beside him, a Chow panted, the chuff-chuff filling the silence, black tongue lolling as the dog strained the confines of its short leash.<br><br>"Did you bring the money?" the younger man asked again as he glanced around the park, his anxiety sharp against the cold rage blowing off the other man.<br><br>"Did you really think I'd pay?"<br><br>The older man lunged. A blast of fear, so intense my eyelids quivered. Then a gasp, rich with shock and pain. Chaos rolled over me and moonlight sparked red against the knife blade. The stink of voided bowels filled the air as the younger man staggered back into a spindly maple. He tottered for a moment, propped against it, then slumped at its base.<br><br>The killer pulled his dog closer. The Chow danced, its chaos fluttering past me, confusion warring with hunger. The man shoved its head to the wound, steaming blood pumping. The dog took a tentative lick, then-<br><br>The vision broke and I reeled, grabbing the cenotaph. A moment's pause, eyes squeezed shut. Then I straightened and blinked against the bright morning sun.<br><br>At the foot of the cenotaph, a shrine had started, with plucked daffodils and scraps of paper scrawled with "We'll Miss You, Brian" and "Rest in Peace, Ryan." Anyone who knew Bryan Mills well enough to spell his name was still at home, in shock. The people hugging and sobbing around the shrine were only hoping to catch the eye of a roving TV camera, say a few words about what a great guy "Ryan" had been.<br><br>As I circled the crime scene tape, I passed the fake mourners, and their sobbing rose . . . until they noticed I wasn't carrying a camera, and fell back to sipping steaming coffees and huddling against the icy morning.<br><br>They might not have made me for a reporter, but the closest cop guarding the scene did, his glower telling me not to bother asking for a statement. I'm sure "Hey, I know what happened to your dead guy" would have been a guaranteed conversation opener. But then what would I say?<br><br>"How do I know? Um, I had a vision. Psychic? No. I can only see the past-a talent I inherited from my father. More of a curse, really, though I'm sure he thinks otherwise. Maybe you've heard of him? Lucifer? No, not Satan-that's a whole different guy. I'm what they call a half-demon, a human fathered by a demon. Most of us get a special power, like fire, telekinesis or teleportation, without a demon's need for chaos. But that chaos hunger is all I get, plus a few special powers to help me find it. Like visions of past trauma, which is why I know how your victim died. And I can read chaotic thoughts, like the one going through your head right now, Officer. You're wondering whether you should quietly call for the ambulance or pin me to the ground first, in case my psychotic break turns violent."<br><br>So I stuck to my job: reporting the news, not becoming it. I found a likely target-the youngest officer, buttons gleaming, gaze following the news cameras, shoulders straightening each time one promised to swing his way, then slumping when it moved elsewhere.<br><br>As I approached, his gaze traveled over me and his chin lifted to showcase a square jaw. A smile tweaked his lips. When I took out my notebook, the smile ignited, and he stepped forward to intercept me, lest I change my mind.<br><br>"Hello, there," he said. "I haven't seen you before. New at the Gazette?"<br><br>I shook my head. "I'm national."<br><br>His eyes glittered, envisioning his name in Time or USA Today. I always felt a little bad about that. True News was a national publication, though . . . a national supermarket tabloid.<br><br>"Hope Adams," I said, thrusting out my hand.<br><br>"Adams?"<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>A flush bloomed on his cheeks. "Sorry, I, uh, wasn't sure I heard that right."<br><br>Apparently, I didn't look like this officer's idea of a "Hope Adams." My mother had been a student from India when she met my dad at college. Will Adams, though, was not my biological father, and half-demons inherit their appearance from their maternal DNA.<br><br>As I chatted him up, a man lurched from behind the cenotaph. He peered around, his eyes wild behind green-lensed glasses. Spying us, he strode over, one black-nailed finger jabbing.<br><br>"You took him, didn't you?"<br><br>The officer's hand slid to his belt. "Sir, you need to step back-"<br><br>"Or what?" The man stopped inches from the officer, swaying. "You'll shoot me? Like you shot him? Take me away too? Study me? Dissect me? Then deny everything?"<br><br>"If you mean the victim-"<br><br>"I meant the werewolf."<br><br>The officer cleared his throat. "There, uh, was no werewolf, sir. The victim was-"<br><br>"Eaten!" The man leaned forward, spittle flying. "Torn apart and eaten! Tracks everywhere. You can't cover it up this time."<br><br>"A werewolf?" said a woman, sidling over as she passed. "I heard that too."<br><br>The officer slid a small "can you believe this?" smile my way. I struggled to return it. I could believe that people thought this was a werewolf; that's why True News had sent their "weird tales girl" to cover the story. As for werewolves themselves, I certainly believed in them-though even before the vision I'd known this wasn't one of their kills.<br><br>"Sorry about that," the officer said when he'd finally moved the conspiracy theorist on.<br>"Werewolves? Dare I even ask where that rumor came from?"<br><br>"The kids who found the body got all freaked out, seeing dog tracks around it, and they started posting online about werewolves. I have no idea how the dog got involved."<br><br>I was already mentally writing my story. "When asked about the werewolf rumors, an officer on the site admitted he couldn't explain the combined signs of canine and human." That's the trick of writing for a tabloid. You take the facts and massage them, hinting, implying, suggesting . . . As long as no one is humiliated unfairly, and no sources are named, I don't have a problem giving readers the entertainment they want.<br><br>Karl would have found it entertaining too. If I'd been assigned this story a couple of months ago, I'd have been waiting for his next call, so I could say, "Hey, I got a werewolf story. Can I get a statement?" He'd make some sardonic comment, and I'd curl up, settling in for a long talk, telling myself it was just friendship, that I'd never be fool enough to fall for Karl Marsten. Kidding myself, of course. The moment I let him cross that line past friendship, I got burned . . . and it was just as bad as I'd always feared.<br><br>I pushed memories of Karl aside and concentrated on the story. The officer had just let slip a lead on the kids who'd found the body-two girls who worked at the 7-Eleven on the corner-when clouds suddenly darkened the day to twilight. Thunder boomed, and I dropped my pen. As the officer bent to grab it, I snuck a glance around. No one was looking at the sky or running for cover. They were all carrying on as they had been.<br><br>The officer kept talking, but I could barely hear him through the thunderclaps. I gritted my teeth and waited for the vision to end. A storm moving in? Possible, if it promised enough destruction to qualify as chaotic. But I suspected the source was a Tempestras-a "storm" half-demon. One offshoot of my "gift" was the ability to sense other supernaturals through their chaotic powers.<br><br>I cast another surreptitious glance around. My gaze settled instead on the one person I hadn't noticed before. A dark-haired man, at least six foot three, with a linebacker's body ill-concealed by a custom-tailored suit.<br><br>He seemed to be looking my way, but with his dark sunglasses it was impossible to tell. Then he lowered them, pale blue eyes meeting mine, chin dipping in greeting. He walked over.<br><br>"Ms. Adams? A word please?" <br><i><br>Hope<br>Godfather</i><br><br> I checked for chaos vibes and felt nothing. Still, any time a hulking half-demon stranger sought me out hundreds of miles from my home, I had reason to be alarmed.<br><br>"Let's head over there."<br><br>He nodded to a quiet corner under an elm. When we stopped, he shivered and looked up into the dense branches.<br><br>"Not the warmest spot," he said. "I guess that's why it's the one empty corner in the park. No sunshine."<br><br>"But you could fix that."<br><br>I braced myself for a denial. Instead I got a grin that thawed his ice-blue eyes.<br><br>"Now that's a handy talent. I could use that in my line of work."<br><br>"And that would be?"<br><br>"Troy Morgan," he said, as if in answer. "My boss would like to talk to you."<br><br>The name clicked-Benicio Cortez's personal bodyguard.<br><br>I followed Troy's gaze to a vehicle idling fifty feet away. A white SUV with Cadillac emblems on the wheels. Beside it stood a dark-haired man who could pass for Troy's twin. If both of Benicio Cortez's bodyguards were her...</p><h2>With William Burroughs: A Report From the Bunker</h2><p><p>Burroughs, the eccentric, brilliant artist who burned the bridge with logic and wrote the classic Naked Lunch, has a court recorder in Victor Bockris. Bockris has collected into a cogent whole the man's most brilliant moments of conversation, thinking, and interview repartee. This fascinating material, gleaned from the fertile time at Burroughs's New York headquarters, the Bunker (which was located on the Bowery, three blocks from CBGB), encompasses the years 1974 to 1980, and also includes a 1991 Burroughs interview from Interview magazine. The Beats' devotion to subjective experience has left readers with a profound amount of objective material to analyze and debate. Choice public and private utterances, hallucinatory and prescient diatribes such as these, remain rich sources of literary history. As Americans we find the Beats' approach to life romantic, even heroic. Tearing the walls down in the name of freedom and spirituality strikes a particularly pilgrimesque chord.

The focus, of course, is on the perennial miscommunication between the sexes-women tend to overcommunicate via an emotional litany of suggestions and complaints, while men tend to undercommunicate by dismissing women's concerns and withdrawing into their "caves"-and practical ways to overcome it. The condensed format, which offers little room for qualifications and nuances, sometimes highlights Gray's oversimplification of male-female differences. His sunny belief that "all big marital problems first began as little problems that were not resolved" seems too optimistic, and glib tips like "Laugh at his jokes" and "Really enjoy having sex with him" may be little help when both the jokes and the sex are uninspiring. Still, Gray has a good feel for the particulars of domestic friction, and many couples will see a bit of themselves in his caricatures-if they haven't already, that is: Gray's signature volume has sold over 14 million copies worldwide.

Throughout his long and prolific career as a pianist, conductor, composer, and educator, this Swiss/American musician represented an incomparable link between the old and new. Personal recollections included Liszt and Brahms and friendships with Busoni, Paderewski, Schweitzer, Toscanini, Theodore Thomas, Rachmaninoff, and Bartok. Ravel, Griffes, and Tcherepnin, among others, dedicated important compositions to him. His programs frequently offered first performances of contemporary music. As late as 1962, at age 85, Ganz continued to pioneer new music at the First International Webern Festival.<br><br>This first biography of Rudolf Ganz not only fills an important and missing gap in the history of the "golden age" of pianism, but provides the first balanced appraisal of Ganz's tenure as conductor of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra (1921-27). The author also traces Ganz's role as one of America's most imaginative and influential music educators. As conductor of the children and young people's concerts in St. Louis (1922-27), New York (1939-48), San Francisco (1939-48),and Chicago (1944-46), Ganz was responsible for introducing American youth to classical music during the early decades of this century. He extended his influence in education as president of the Chicago Musical College (1934-54) and a member of its faculty (1900-05 and 1928-69). The biography is illustrated and includes extensive endnotes and appendixes.</p><p><b>Jeanne Colette Collester</b> (M.Ed., Miami University of Ohio; MA, Washington University, St. Louis) is the step-daughter of Rudolph Ganz.

Prot�g� of Alain Locke, roommate of Wallace Thurman, and friend of Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, the precocious Nugent stood for many years as the only African-American writer willing to clearly pronounce his homosexuality in print. His contribution to the landmark publication <i>FIRE!!</i>, &#x201c;Smoke, Lilies and Jade,&#x201d; was unprecedented in its celebration of same-sex desire.

The new technologies are diving bells, pneumatic winches, and "sucking-worm" drainage engines; but they are also wireless telecommunication devices, patented biotechnology processes, and revolutionary electronic Internet routers. Only the sense of unlimited possibility remains the same throughout.<br><br>Unfolding simultaneously in two distant--but remarkably similar--periods of history, <i>Extravagance</i> is a comic, pictaresque novel of financial mania, the story of a world gripped by a terminal case of irrational exuberance. Navigating the perils of both eras is a single cast of characters: Will himself, a young man on the make, eager to do whatever it takes to make his fortune; Will's uncle (and sponsor) Gilbert Hawking, a shrewd businessman with one foot in the Old Economy and one in the New; Benjamin Fletcher, the developer of a pioneering new technology destined to set the world on fire; and Theodore Witherspoon, the cheerfully unscrupulous wizard of the financial markets who promises to make them all wealthy beyond their dreams.<br><br>Meanwhile, Will's aspirations are complicated by his pursuit of Ben Fletcher's sister, Eliza, the gorgeous and disconcertingly aggressive woman who is as desirable as she is elusive. Can Will succeed in his efforts to win both Eliza and the fortune that her brother's new technology seems likely to bring him? And can he make it all happen before the general euphoria of the age reaches its inevitable climax?<br><br><i>Extravagance</i> is a uniquely conceived work of high comic entertainment -- an ultra-smart time machine of a novel that proves that both love and greed are timeless.</p><p><p>&#x201c;Superlatively and consistently engrossing . . . a masterfully realized conceit . . . <i>Extravagance</i> is substantial and a fast, fun read.&#x201d; &#x2014;Daniel Cariaga, <i>Los Angeles Times<br></i></p><p>&#x201c;Ingenious . . . a most agreeable and antic diversion.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael M.

This gripping portrait of the western Himalayan land known as Little Tibet&#x201d; moves from the author&#x2019;s first visit to idyllic, nonindustrial Ladakh in 1974 to the present, tracking profound changes as the region was opened to foreign tourists, Western goods and technologies, and pressures for economic growth. These changes in turn brought generational conflict, unemployment, inflation, environmental damage, and threats to the traditional way of life.<br> Appalled by these negative impacts, the author helped establish the Ladakh Project (later renamed the International Society for Ecology and Culture) to seek sustainable solutions that preserve cultural integrity and environmental health, while addressing the Ladakhis&#x2019; hunger for modernization. This model undertaking effectively combines educational programs for all social levels with the design, demonstration, and promotion of appropriate technologies such as solar heating and small-scale hydro power. <br>Examining how modernization changes the way people live and think, Norberg-Hodge challenges us to redefine our concepts of development&#x201d; and progress.&#x201d; Above all, <i>Ancient Futures</i> stresses the need to carry traditional wisdom into the future our urgent task as a global community.</p><p>"The celebration here of traditional Ladakhi life induces exhilaration but also sadness, as if some half-remembered paradise known in another life had now been lost. So evocative is it that I felt -- I'm not sure what -- homesickness?"<p>Peter Matthiessen, from the Introduction</p><p>"Though full of stories and photographs of the Ladakhi way of life. [Ancient Futures] is much more than a travelogue; it is . . . an ecologue ....

Y eso s� que es malo.</p><p>Y lo que es peor: la se�ora Brisbane ha regresado. Hasta el d�a de hoy, yo ni siquiera sab�a que exist�a una se�ora Brisbane. Por suerte.</p><p>Y ahora me pregunto: �qu� es lo que pensaba la se�orita Mac? Ella ten�a que saber que pronto se ir�a sin m�. Y que la se�ora Brisbane regresar�a al Aula 26, y yo no tendr�a escapatoria posible.</p><p>A m� todav�a me gusta; bueno, a decir verdad, <i>quiero</i> a la se�orita Mac m�s que a ning�n otro humano o h�mster en la tierra, pero me sigo preguntando: �en qu� estaba pensando?</p><p>&#x201c;Uno puede llegar a conocerse mejor si cuida a otras especies&#x201d;, me dijo, de camino a casa, el d�a que me compr�. &#x201c;Estoy segura de que los chicos aprender�n m�s de una cosa de ti.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Eso</i> fue la que ella pens�. Pero no creo que lo pensara muy bien.</p><p>Nunca le volver� a hablar, aunque es probable que no la vuelva a ver, porque SE FUE-SE FUE-SE FUE... , pero si alg�n d�a regresara, ni siquiera la mirar�a.</p><p>(S� que lo que he dicho no tiene mucho sentido, pero es dif�cil pensar l�gicamente cuando tu coraz�n est� partido.)</p><p>Por otra parte, hasta que la se�orita Mac apareci�, yo no ten�a futuro en Mascotalandia. Me pasaba los d�as enteros sentado, mirando a los otros seres peludos encerrados en jaulas como yo. No me quejo; nos trataban bien: tres comidas diarias, una jaula limpia y m�sica de fondo todo el d�a.</p><p>A pesar de la m�sica, Carlos, el dependiente, siempre contestaba el tel�fono: &#x201c;Abiertos de nueve a nueve, siete d�as a la semana. Esquina a la Quinta Avenida y calle Alder, al lado de <i>La Vaca Lechera</i>&#x201d;.</p><p>Por aquel entonces, yo ni siquiera pensaba ver la Quinta Avenida o la calle Alder, y mucho menos <i>La Vaca Lechera</i>. A veces ve�a unos ojos o una nariz humana (no muy limpia, por cierto) mirando por el escaparate, pero aparte de eso, no ocurr�a nada. Los ni�os se alegraban al verme; sin embargo, sus padres pensaban de otra manera. </p><p>&#x201c;Ven aqu�, Cornelia, mira qu� lindos pececitos de colores. Y son m�s f�ciles de cuidar que un h�mster&#x201d;, sol�a decir la madre.</p><p>O, &#x201c;Deja eso, Norberto. Mira qu� cachorritos tan lindos hay aqu�. Recuerda que no hay mejor amigo que un perro&#x201d;. </p><p>Esa era la triste realidad: los h�msteres, los jerbos o los curieles no lleg�bamos a la altura de los peces, los gatos o los perros. Me ve�a el resto de mi vida dando vueltas en mi rueda.</p><p>Pero el d�a, hace solo seis semanas, que la se�orita Mac me sac� por la puerta, mi vida cambi� DE REPENTE. Vi la Quinta Avenida, la calle Alder y <i>La Vaca Lechera</i>, con delantal puesto y todo.</p><p>Cuando ella entr� a Mascotalandia, yo estaba medio dormido, como acostumbro a hacer durante el d�a, ya que los h�msteres somos m�s activos por la noche. </p><p>&#x2014;Hola. </p><p>Me despert� el sonido de una voz c�lida. Cuando abr� los ojos, me top� con una mata de pelo negro rizado, una amplia sonrisa y unos enormes ojos negros. Ol�a a manzana. Fue amor a primera vista.</p><p>&#x2014;�Qu� ojos tan bonitos tienes! &#x2014;dijo ella.</p><p>&#x2014;Y usted lo mismo &#x2014;contest� yo. Desde luego son� m�s a chillido que a un cumplido. </p><p>La se�orita Mac abri� su bolso con flores azules y rosas.</p><p>&#x2014;Me lo llevo &#x2014;le dijo a Carlos&#x2014;. A simple vista, se sabe que es el h�mster m�s guapo e inteligente de toda la tienda.</p><p>Carlos respondi� con un gru�ido. Entonces, la se�orita Mac seleccion� una jaula bastante respetable; no era la pagoda de tres pisos que a m� me gustaba, pero tampoco estaba mal.</p><p>Y pronto, entre la algarab�a de mis compa�eros y amigos, desde el diminuto ratoncito blanco hasta la lenta chinchilla, sal� de Mascotalandia con grandes esperanzas.</p><p>Subimos al auto amarillo de la se�orita Mac y se puso en marcha a toda velocidad. (Ella se refer�a al auto como &#x201c;la pulga&#x201d;, pero yo estaba seguro de que era un auto.) Cuando llegamos, subi� la jaula tres pisos hasta su apartamento. Comimos manzanas. Miramos la tele. Me sac� de la jaula y me dej� correr por el suelo. Me puso un nombre: Humphrey. Y me habl� sobre el Aula 26, adonde ir�amos a la ma�ana siguiente.</p><p>&#x2014;Como eres un h�mster inteligente y vas a ir a la escuela, tengo un regalo para ti &#x2014;dijo ella.</p><p>Y me entreg� un peque�o cuaderno y un l�piz diminuto.</p><p>&#x2014;Los compr� en la tienda de mu�ecas &#x2014;me explic�. Entonces los coloc� detr�s del espejo de mi jaula donde solo yo pod�a verlos. </p><p>&#x2014;Desde luego que te llevar� un tiempo aprender a leer y a escribir, pero eres inteligente y estoy segura de que aprender�s pronto.</p><p>Ella ni siquiera se imaginaba que ya sab�a varias palabras que aprend� durante esos largos y aburridos d�as en Mascotalandia, palabras como <i>champ�-quita-pulgas</i>, <i>galletas para perros o recoge-cacas</i>. </p><p>Recuerden que un h�mster llega a su madurez a las cinco semanas. Si en cinco semanas puedo aprender todo lo que necesito en la vida, �cu�nto tiempo tardar� en aprender a leer?</p><p>No m�s de una semana. En una semana podr� leer e incluso escribir algo con mi l�piz diminuto.</p><p>Adem�s de las asignaturas de la escuela, aprend� bastantes cosas de los otros alumnos del Aula 26, como de Baja-la-Voz-James, Habla-M�s-Alto-Selma, Espera-por-la Campana-Gregory, y No-Corras-Miranda. (Aunque, a decir verdad, nunca la vi correr. Yo s� que corro en mi rueda.)</p><p>Durante el d�a, me sent�a feliz en el Aula 26. Mi jaula ten�a todas las comodidades que un h�mster pod�a desear. Ten�a unos peque�os barrotes para protegerme de mis enemigos. En una esquina, ten�a un peque�o y c�modo rinconcito para dormir, donde nadie me pod�a ver o molestar. Hab�a una rueda para que yo pudiera dar vueltas. El espejo resultaba muy �til para comprobar mi aspecto f�sico de vez en cuando y para mantener oculto el cuaderno y el l�piz. En una esquina, almacenaba mi comida, la opuesta, era el �rea reservada para mis necesidades, porque a los h�msteres les gusta mantener separado el alimento del excremento. (Y a qui�n no.) En fin, que la jaula ten�a todo lo que yo necesitaba.</p><p>Por las noches, me iba a casa con la se�orita Mac. Mir�bamos la tele o escuch�bamos m�sica. A veces, la se�orita Mac tocaba los bongos. Ella hizo un t�nel en el suelo para que yo pudiera correr libremente y divertirme a mis anchas.</p><p>�Qu� maravillosos recuerdos tengo de esas seis semanas con Morgan McNamara! Ese es su verdadero nombre, pero como es tan buena o, mejor dicho, era, le dijo a los estudiantes que pod�an llamarla se�orita Mac. </p><p>Durante los fines de semana, la se�orita Mac y yo corr�amos toda clase de aventuras. Me colocaba en el bolsillo de su blusa, justo sobre su coraz�n, y me llevaba a la lavander�a. Ten�a amigos que la visitaban, se divert�an y me mimaban todo el tiempo. Incluso, en una ocasi�n, me llev� a pasear en bicicleta. �Todav�a siento el aire en mi piel!</p><p>No ten�a la menor idea, hasta esta ma�ana, de lo que iba a hacer. De camino a la escuela, me dijo:</p><p>&#x2014;Humphrey, no s� c�mo dec�rtelo, pero hoy es mi �ltimo d�a en el Aula 26, y te voy a extra�ar m�s de lo que te puedes imaginar. </p><p>�Qu� me estaba contando? �Me agarr� a mi rueda como si de ello dependiera mi vida!</p><p>&#x2014;Ver�s, en realidad, es la clase de la se�ora Brisbane, pero justo antes de que comenzara el curso, su esposo sufri� un accidente y yo me hice cargo de su clase. Ahora ya est� bien y por eso hoy regresa definitivamente.</p><p>�Definitivamente? �Qu� es eso de definitivamente? No me gustan las cosas que son definitivas.</p><p>&#x2014;Adem�s, Humphrey, en realidad quiero conocer el mundo... &#x2014;a�adi�.</p><p>Eso me parec�a estupendo. Hasta ahora hab�a disfrutado de todo lo que hab�a visto en el mundo e ir�a hasta el infinito con la se�orita Mac, pero obviamente ella no hab�a terminado de hablar.</p><p>&#x2014;... si bien, lamentablemente, no puedo llevarte conmigo.</p><p>Todas mis esperanzas se vinieron abajo. Completamente.</p><p>&#x2014;Adem�s, los ni�os del Aula 26 te necesitan para que les ense�es a ser responsables. Y la se�ora Brisbane tambi�n te necesita.</p><p>Desafortunadamente, nadie se lo dijo a la se�ora Brisbane.</p><p>La se�ora Brisbane estaba ya en el aula cuando nosotros llegamos.

Coloc� mi jaula en su lugar, cerca de la ventana, y simplemente dijo que los chicos se hab�an encari�ado conmigo. Al lado de la jaula dej� una copia del libro <i>Gu�a para el cuidado y alimentaci�n de los h�msteres, </i>escrito por el Dr. Harvey H. Hammer, y una tabla que indicaba las veces que ten�an que darme de comer y limpiar la jaula. </p><p>&#x2014;Los ni�os saben lo que tienen que hacer. En realidad, usted no tiene que hacer nada &#x2014;le explic� la se�orita Mac, mientras la se�ora Brisbane no dejaba de mirarme fijamente.</p><p>Justo en ese momento, mis compa�eros de clase entraron corriendo y, en menos de media hora, la se�orita Mac se hab�a despedido de todos, incluy�ndome a m�.</p><p>&#x2014;Nunca te olvidar�, Humphrey &#x2014;me susurr� cerca de la jaula&#x2014;. No me olvides t� tampoco.</p><p>&#x2014;Dudo que me pueda olvidar de usted, pero no estoy tan seguro de que alg�n d�a pueda perdonarla &#x2014;chill�.</p><p>Y entonces se fue. Sin m�.</p><p>La se�ora Brisbane no se acerc� a mi jaula hasta la hora del recreo. Se inclin� y me dijo:</p><p>&#x2014;Me temo que t� tambi�n tendr�s que irte.</p><p>Pero, por suerte, ella no conoc�a mi secreto: la cerradura de la puerta de mi jaula no trabajaba. Nunca hab�a funcionado.

En seguida los guard� en la bolsa que tengo junto a las mejillas hasta poder dejarlos en mi jaula. A los h�msteres nos encanta almacenar comida para el futuro.</p><p>Una vez que mi jaula estuvo reluciente, me dediqu� a observar a la se�ora Brisbane con detenimiento.</p><p>La se�orita Mac era alta, usaba blusas de colores vivos, faldas cortas y zapatos de tac�n alto. Llevaba brazaletes que sonaban como campanillas. Hablaba en voz alta y gesticulaba con las manos mientras ense�aba, caminando entre los pupitres.</p><p>Por el contrario, la se�ora Brisbane era bajita, de cabello gris corto. Usaba ropa de colores oscuros y zapatos bajos, y cuando caminaba no se escuchaban las campanillas. Apenas se o�a su voz, y ense�aba sentada desde su escritorio o de pie, en la pizarra.</p><p>No en balde me estaba quedando dormido despu�s del almuerzo. Com� bastante, y con esa voz que era apenas un susurro... </p><p>&#x2014;�Es eso todo lo que sabe hacer este h�mster, dormir? &#x2014;pregunt� en un momento que mir� en direcci�n a mi jaula.</p><p>&#x2014;Es que es &#x201c;turno&#x201d; &#x2014;dijo Levanta-la-Mano-Ana Montana. </p><p>&#x2014;Levanta-la-Mano-Ana &#x2014;dijo la se�ora Brisbane&#x2014;. �Qu� quieres decir por &#x201c;turno&#x201d;? </p><p>&#x2014;Ya sabe, &#x201c;turno&#x201d;, que duerme de d�a &#x2014;explic� Ana.</p><p>De repente, me despert� sobresaltado:</p><p>&#x2014;&#x201c;Nocturno&#x201d;&#x2014;chill�&#x2014;.

The author draws on published materials from Russian and Western sources, and combines historical and political analyses to examine the origins, present structure, organization, functioning, and role of the KGB in enforcing security and policy. For this edition an epilogue covering 1987-1989 has been added.</p><p>Recent interest in the Soviet Union has spawned a plethora of works on the KGB and its nefarious activities, but a shortage of unbiased scholarship remains. Knight, a Soviet affairs specialist, examines the KGB's origins and evolution, structure, and functions to describe and analyze "the KGB as a political institution." Serious students will value the extensive references to Russian and Western sources, detailed information on the background of KGB cadres, and absence of polemic. Lay readers will find the approach tedious and the detail excessive at points. But this treatment of KGB-Communist Party relations is better than William Corson and Robert Crowley's The New KGB ( LJ 9/1/85), especially for academic collections. James R.

From the Ainu to the Mongols, from Hokkaido to Okinawa, from the landscapes of China to the backcountry of contemporary Japan, from the temples of Daitokoji to the Yellow River Valley, it is now clear how this work has influenced his poetry, his stance as an environmental and political activist, and his long practice of Zen. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, Asia became a vocation for Snyder. While most American writers looked to the capitals of Europe for their inspiration, Snyder looked west to the East. American letters is profoundly indebted to this geographical choice.<br><br>Long rumored to exist, <i>The Great Clod</i> collects several published in <i>The Coevolution Quarterly</i> almost forty years ago when Snyder briefly described this work as The China Book,&#x201d; and several others, the majority, never before published in any form. Summer in Hokkaido,&#x201d; Wild in China,&#x201d; Ink and Charcoal,&#x201d; Wolf-Hair Brush,&#x201d; these essays turn from being memoirs of travel to prolonged considerations of art, culture, natural history and religion. It is filled with Snyder&#x2019;s remarkable insights and briskly beautiful descriptions.</p><p><b>Gary Snyder</b> is the author of sixteen collections of poetry and prose. Since 1970 he has lived in the watershed of the South Yuba River in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1975 and a finalist for the National Book Award in 1992, he has been awarded the Bollingen Poetry Prize and the Robert Kirsch Lifetime Achievement Award.<br>His newest book of prose, <i>The Great Clod</i> is a series of essays on Asia&#x2019;s ecological history, combining culture and politics in a way that is, unsurprisingly, poetic and graceful. <i>The Great Clod</i> may be slim but its scope is immense.&#x201d; <i>The Japan Times</i><br><br> Classical poetry, calligraphy, the best source of temple incense all figure in the text, which has something of the feel of a valediction. Elegant and thoughtful, with much to read between the lines in commentary on a long life's work. Students and admirers of Snyder will be enchanted and intrigued.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus</i><br><br> Each essay furnishes a graceful, very conversational (sentence fragments and all), but keenly well-informed enticement to pursue its subject further. This kind of friendly, even compassionate, mode of instruction comes, of course, from the American arguably most responsible for spreading appreciation of East Asia among North Americans. If this little book should prove Snyder&#x2019;s last word on East Asia, it is wonderfully enough.&#x201d; <i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Snyder is an elder statesman of the natural world and the tribal unions of poetry. He has a body of work as original as predecessors Williams Carlos Williams and Wallace Stevens." <i>The Bloomsbury Review</i><br><br>"His greatest strength a quiet and profound elegance, an ability to write a simple phrase that seems to have been echoing through human consciousness for three or four thousand years." Lewis MacAdams, <i>California Magazine</i><br><br>"This poet's great gift has always been perfect visual clarity...and, needless to say, derives from Snyder's vision in the larger sense." Paul Berman, <i>Village Voice</i><br><br>"What thoughtful beauty! How skillfully Gary Snyder interfuses the practical knowledge of an animal sense with story, language, and song. True teachers in American are now an endangered species. I learn so much from this good man's perception, humor, discipline, and love for this world."

He is a specialist on music of the twentieth century and has published widely on this subject in the fields of music theory and musicology. His previous book is <i>The Music of Charles Ives</i>.Do you remember the first time you heard <i>Pet Sounds</i>? It still takes my breath away, forty years later, but I'll never forget that jaw-dropping moment when Brian Wilson's masterpiece first entered my consciousness. It seemed just so far removed from anything that seemed possible in a rock album, so deep and sensitive and finely crafted that it surely came from a world beyond this one... I've written this book because I had to know more about the remarkable creative spirit behind <i>Pet Sounds</i> and the Beach Boys. I wanted to know every detail about Brian Wilson's music before and after his magnum opus... Of course, I knew something about the life he has lived, especially the publicity-grabbing circumstances of his difficult childhood, up-and-down relationships with his brothers and the group that made him famous, battles with substance abuse and depression, and legal squabbles. But I was sure that his music alone told a story that was interesting on its own, and that was naturally interwoven with his biography. That's the story I've set out to tell in this book...</p><h2>The Way of the Coyote (Texas Rangers)</h2><p>The Civil War has ended, and Union soldiers and federal officials have taken control of Texas as Rusty Shannon rides to his home on the Colorado River. As a child he was a captive of the Comanche, as a young man a proud member of a ranging company protecting settlers from Indian raids. Shannon's fate is intertwined with the young man accompanying him: Andy Pickard, himself but recently rescued from Comanche captivity and known by his captors as Badger Boy. Texas is in turmoil, overrun with murderous outlaws, lawmen exacting penalties from suspected former Confederates, nightriders, and the ever-dangerous Comanche bands. In this tempestuous time and place, Rusty tries desperately to resume his prewar life. His friend Shanty, a freed slave, is burned out of his home by the Ku Klux Klan; his own homestead is confiscated by his special nemesis, the murderous Oldham brothers; and the son of a girl he once loved is kidnapped by Comanches. Elmer Kelton, a master of novelist of the American West, literature, has crafted a satisfying and remarkably accurate tale of Texas life at the end of the Civil War.<br><br>Elmer Kelton, most honored of all Western writers, writes of the formative years of the Texas Rangers with the knowledge of a native Texan and the skill of a master storyteller. In Rusty Shannon, tough and smart--necessary survival attributes on the 1860s Texas frontier--Kelton has created one of the most memorable characters in modern Western fiction.<br></p><p>Elmer Kelton, author of more than forty novels, grew up on a ranch near Crane, Texas, and earned a journalism degree from the University of Texas. His first novel, <i>Hot Iron</i>, was published in 1956. For forty-two years he had a parallel career in agricultural journalism.<br><br>Among his awards have been seven Spurs from Western Writers of America and four Western Heritage awards from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. Among his best-known works have been <i>The Time It Never Rained </i>and<i> The Good Old Boys</i>, the latter made into a television film starring Tommy Lee Jones.<br><br>He served in the infantry in World War II. He and his wife, Ann, a native of Austria, live in San Angelo, Texas. They have three children, four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>An old arrow wound in Rusty Shannon&#x2019;s leg had been aching all day, but the sudden appearance of Indians made the pain fall away.<br>&#x201c;Them damned Comanches,&#x201d; he declared to the boy. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t ever give up.&#x201d; <br>Sitting on his black horse, Alamo, he squinted anxiously over the edge of a dry ravine toward half a dozen horsemen three hundred yards away. They milled about, studying the tracks marking the way Rusty and young Andy Pickard had come.<br>An afternoon sun glared upon the summer-curing grass. Open prairie stretched to the uneven horizon like a wind-rippled sea. To run would be futile, for both horses had come a long way and were as tired as their riders. This ravine was the only place to hide, though it seemed more likely to be a trap than a refuge.<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re comin&#x2019; on,&#x201d; he said. He drew the rifle from its scabbard beneath his leg. <br>Dread was in the boy&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;It is for me they come, not you. I go to them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hell no! I didn&#x2019;t bring you this far...&#x201d;<br>He did not finish, for the boy drummed moccasined heels against his horse&#x2019;s ribs and put it up out of the ravine before Rusty could move to stop him. Andy could easily be taken for an Indian. His hair was braided. He wore a breechcloth and carried a boy-sized bow. A quiver of arrows lay across his back, a rawhide strap holding it against his shoulder. He made no move to bring the bow into use.<br>He stopped his pony and looked over his shoulder as Rusty spurred to catch up. The boy said, &#x201c;You stay back. They are friends of the one I shot. They want me.&#x201d;<br>Andy avoided speaking the name of Tonkawa Killer. To do so might anger the dead man&#x2019;s dark spirit and spur it to mischief against the living.<br>Rusty checked the cartridge in the chamber. &#x201c;Maybe this rifle can convince them they don&#x2019;t want you all that bad.&#x201d;<br>He stepped down, putting the horse between him and the oncoming Indians. He steadied the barrel across the saddle.<br>The boy&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t shoot. They are my people.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not if they&#x2019;re out to kill you. They&#x2019;re not your people, and they sure ain&#x2019;t mine.&#x201d;<br>Andy Pickard had been taken from a Texas settler family as a small boy and raised Comanche. Rusty guessed him to be around ten, too young to carry such a heavy burden on thin shoulders. His sun-browned skin gave him an Indian appearance, but in close quarters his blue eyes would give him away. They were deeply troubled as he watched the warriors move toward him and Rusty.<br>&#x201c;They come because I did a bad hing,&#x201d; Andy said.<br>He had violated a basic tribal taboo; he had killed a Comanche warrior. Now he was subject to retribution in kind by the dead man&#x2019;s friends and family.<br>Rusty said, &#x201c;You had to do it. That evil-eyed Comanche was set on killin&#x2019; the both of us.&#x201d; His hand sweated against the stock of the rifle. Andy might foolishly consent to yield himself up, but Rusty had no intention of letting him. &#x201c;Soon&#x2019;s they come in range, I&#x2019;ll knock down a horse. Show them we mean business and maybe they&#x2019;ll turn back.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They not turn back.&#x201d;<br>As the Indians came close enough, Rusty thumbed the hammer. The click seemed almost as loud as a shot.<br>Andy said, &#x201c;Wait. They are not Comanche.&#x201d;<br>Rusty&#x2019;s lungs burned from holding his breath. He gasped for air. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They are Kiowa.&#x201d;<br>Rusty wiped a sweaty hand against his trouser leg. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see where that&#x2019;s any improvement.&#x201d; Kiowas shared the Comanches&#x2019; implacable hostility toward Texans. Rusty had seen people killed by Kiowas. They were no less dead than those who fell to Comanches.<br>The boy said, &#x201c;Kiowas no look for me. I go talk.&#x201d; <br>He did not ask for Rusty&#x2019;s approval. He raised one hand and rode forward. Surprised, the Kiowas paused for council. Rusty quickly remounted and caught up to Andy.<br>&#x201c;Damn it, young&#x2019;un, you&#x2019;re askin&#x2019; to be killed.&#x201d; <br>The boy did not respond. Instead, he began moving his hands, talking in sign language. The motions took Rusty by surprise, but they amazed the Indians more...a white boy communicating in the silent language common to the plains tribes. Rusty kept a strong but nervous grip on the rifle, careful not to point it directly at the Indians. He was keenly aware that several stared at him with hating eyes that bespoke murder. It would not take much to provoke the thought into the deed.<br>One Kiowa responded with hand signals. A single thick braid hung down over a shoulder, past his waist, the hair augmented by horsehair and fur. The other side was cut short to show off ear pendants of bear claws and a shining silver coin. Rusty sensed a gradual easing of the Indians&#x2019; attitude. He saw grudging acceptance, though he perceived that some warriors remained in favor of hanging his scalp from a lodge pole. Red hair was a novelty to them. <br>He said, &#x201c;They must think it&#x2019;s strange to see a white Comanche boy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There are others. Not just me.&#x201d;<br>Like Andy, numbers of Texan and Mexican children had been taken captive and raised Comanche. Such forced adoption was one way the tribe offset losses caused by war and accidents of the hunt.<br>Andy said in a low voice, &#x201c;I tell them you are my white brother. We been to trade with the Comanche.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s bid them goodbye before their thinkin&#x2019; changes.&#x201d;<br>The boy resumed the sign talk. The only part Rusty understood was when he pointed southeastward and indicated that to be their chosen direction. The Kiowas quarreled among themselves. Rusty could tell that a couple of the youngest favored freeing the boy but killing his white brother. Fortunately the older warriors prevailed.<br>Andy said, &#x201c;No look back.&#x201d; He set his pony to moving in a walk to demonstrate that he had no fear.<br>Rusty forced himself to stare ahead and not turn in the saddle. He wished he could be certain the two hotheads were not following. After a couple of hundred yards Andy let his pony move into an easy trot. Rusty sneaked a quick glance. He was relieved to see that the Kiowas were riding westward, all of them.<br>He wiped his sleeve across his face to take up the cold sweat that stung his eyes. &#x201c;You sure pulled our bacon out of the fire that time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bacon? We got no bacon.&#x201d; Andy&#x2019;s puzzled look showed that he did not understand. Many expressions went over his head. He had only lately begun hearing the English language again after years of exposure only to Comanche.<br>Rusty said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve still got a ways to go before we can take an easy breath. We&#x2019;d better ride into the night as far as these horses can travel.&#x201d;<br>Andy looked back over his shoulder toward the broad prairie and everything he was leaving behind. He appeared about to weep.<br>Gently Rusty said, &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s hard. Go ahead and cry. Ain&#x2019;t nobody around to hear you but me.&#x201d;<br>Andy squared his shoulders. &#x201c;I would hear.&#x201d; <br>* * *<br>The Red River was behind them, but caution prevailed upon Rusty to stop occasionally and survey their back trail. The boy asked, &#x201c;You think they follow so far?&#x201d;<br>Rusty saw no sign of pursuit, yet experience had taught him not to place too much trust in appearances.<br>&#x201c;Depends on how bad they want you.&#x201d;<br>Another long look to the north showed him nothing to arouse anxiety, at least no more than he had carried in the pit of his stomach during the days since he and Andy had hurriedly left the Comanche encampment. They had been two solitary figures on the open plains. The Llano Estacado was a haven to the horseback tribes but remained a forbidding mystery to white Americans, a blank space on their maps. It was a vast country of few landmarks and few tracks. It could swallow up a stranger, lose him in its immensity and doom him to slow starvation. But for several years it had been the only home Andy Pickard could remember. He kept looking behind him.<br>&#x201c;Back there...I belong.&#x201d;<br>Rusty understood the boy&#x2019;s painful dilemma. &#x201c;Them Comanches would kill you in a minute.&#x201d;<br>The thin voice quavered. &#x201c;Most are friends.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It don&#x2019;t take but one enemy to kill you.&#x201d; Rusty had been through this argument several times during their flight. He knew the boy remained strongly tempted to turn about and take his chances. Perhaps at his age he did not fully comprehend the finality of death.<br>Rusty had seen much of death in his thirty-something years on the Texas frontier. Comanches had killed his own parents and had taken him when he was but three or four years old. From that point his experience had diverged from Andy&#x2019;s, however. Texan fighters had recovered Rusty a few days after his capture. He had been raised by a childless pioneer couple and given their name, Shannon, because he knew no name of his own.<br>Years later he had followed his foster father&#x2019;s example and attached himself to a frontier company of rangers patrolling the outer line of settlement, guarding against Comanche and Kiowa incursion. He had remained a ranger volunteer during the four years of civil war. That service<br>had exempted him from joining the Confederate Army and fighting against the United States flag old Daddy Mike Shannon had defended with his blood in conflict against Mexico.<br>Hardship had robbed Rusty of his youth, giving him the look and bearing of a man ten years older. His hair was the color of rusted metal, untrimmed in weeks and rushing uncombed against a frayed collar. A heavy growth of red-tinged whiskers hid most of his face, causing a deceptively fierce look belied by the gentleness in his voice. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s tough to turn your back on everything you&#x2019;ve known, but you&#x2019;re<br>white. You belong amongst your own kind.&#x201d;<br>Andy placed his hand against his heart. &#x201c;Here, inside, I Comanche.&#x201d;<br>Another boy might cry, but Andy&#x2019;s Indian-instilled pride would not allow him to give way to that much emotion, not outwardly. Inwardly he could be dying and not show it. Even when Rusty had first found him lying flat on the ground with his leg broken and given up for dead, Andy had not cried.<br>Rusty said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll feel better when we get to some friendly faces.&#x201d;<br>Andy clenched his teeth and looked away.<br>Dusk revealed a campfire several hundred yards ahead. Rusty&#x2019;s first instinct was to circle widely around it, but he reasoned that Indians were unlikely to build so visible a fire this near to settlements.<br>Andy asked, &#x201c;The Monahan farm?&#x201d; That had been Rusty&#x2019;s first announced goal.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not far enough south yet.&#x201d;<br>If it were still wartime Rusty would suspect that the camp belonged to deserters from the Confederate army or men trying to escape conscription officers. But most of the hideout brush men had dispersed peacefully when war&#x2019;s end removed any reason for isolating themselves.<br>He said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d pass them by, but we ain&#x2019;t eaten a fit meal in days. Maybe they even got coffee.&#x201d;<br>He recognized a chance that these might be outlaws. Defeat of the Confederacy had left legal authority badly diminished at state and local levels. The wartime brush men had grown accustomed to living like coyotes, constantly on the dodge from Confederate authorities. Now a minority had turned to raiding isolated farms and villages, stealing horses and whatever else came easily to hand. The risk of punishment was slight where law enforcement was scattered thin and rendered toothless by lack of funds. The Federal occupation forces appeared more interested in punishing former Confederates than in suppressing the lawless<br>or pursuing hostile Indians.<br>Rusty made out the shapes of two wagons. These gave him reassurance, for outlaws were not likely to encumber themselves with anything that moved so slowly. He reined up fifty yards short of the fire to shout, &#x201c;Hello the camp.&#x201d;<br>Several men cautiously edged away from the firelight. An answer came. &#x201c;Come on in.&#x201d;<br>Rusty sensed that several guns were aimed at him. He kept his hands at chest level, away from the pistol at his hip and the rifle in its scabbard. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re peaceable.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So are we.&#x201d; The reply came from someone who moved back into the flickering glow of the fire, holding a rifle at arm&#x2019;s length. Once Rusty could see the lanky, hunched-over form and the long unkempt beard, he was reasonably sure he had encountered the man before.<br>He asked, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I know you from around Fort Belknap?&#x201d;<br>The man peered closely at Rusty. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve freighted goods over that way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I was in the ranger company. Served under Captain Whitfield. And before him, Captain Burmeister.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I remember Whitfield. A good and honest man. But there ain&#x2019;t no rangers since the war ended. What you doin&#x2019; way off out here in the edge of Indian country?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dodgin&#x2019; Indians.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Us too. We&#x2019;re huntin&#x2019; buffalo. Saltin&#x2019; humps and tongues to barter back in the settlements.&#x201d; Barter was almost the only method of exchange in Texas since war&#x2019;s end. Spendable money was as scarce as snow in August. The man turned his attention to Andy, his eyes narrowing in suspicion. &#x201c;What you doin&#x2019; with that Indian kid?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not an Indian. They stole him when he was little. Tried makin&#x2019; him into a Comanche.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got the look of one. I don&#x2019;t know as I&#x2019;d want to run into him in the dark.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good kid. Just not quite sure yet who or what he is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d put some white-boy clothes on him as quick as I could. Else somebody might shoot him for an Indian. Rescued him from the Comanches, did you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more like he rescued me. <br>You-all got any coffee? I&#x2019;d lease my soul to the devil for some fixin&#x2019;s like we had before the war.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a little coffee cut with parched grain. Best we can do. Mix it with whiskey and it ain&#x2019;t too awful. Got some beans and buffalo hump too. You look kind of slab-sided.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Much obliged. We&#x2019;re as hollow as a gourd.&#x201d;<br>Andy had not spoken. He dug into his supper like a starved wolf.<br>The hunter watched him with interest. &#x201c;The boy&#x2019;s got the manners of a wild Indian, all right.&#x201d; The comment was matter-of-fact, not judgmental. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a lot to unlearn him before you can make him white again. He some kin to you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, the only kin we&#x2019;ve found is an uncle. He looked Andy over and turned his back on him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Probably figured he was too far gone to civilize. You figurin&#x2019; to finish raisin&#x2019; him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s got to.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want the responsibility. How did he fall into your lap?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He came down into the settlements on a horse-stealin&#x2019; raid.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That young&#x2019;un ain&#x2019;t old enough.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He sneaked off and followed the raidin&#x2019; party. Didn&#x2019;t let them see him &#x2019;til it was too late to send him back. Horse fell on him and broke his leg. That&#x2019;s the way I found him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He looks all healed up now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We kept him &#x2019;til he was, me and some friends of mine. But he was homesick for the Comanches. If I didn&#x2019;t take him back he was fixin&#x2019; to slip off and go anyway. So, bad as I hated to, I took him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he doin&#x2019; here now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A few of the tribe weren&#x2019;t happy to see him back. He had to kill one so we could get away.&#x201d;<br>The hunter frowned darkly. &#x201c;Awful young to have blood on his hands. It&#x2019;s hard to wash off.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t none of his choosin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If I was you, I&#x2019;d turn him over to the Yankee army. I&#x2019;ve heard they&#x2019;ve got schools for Indian boys back east someplace.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s white. Reckon I&#x2019;ll keep him and do the best I can.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad it&#x2019;s you and not me.&#x201d;<br>Rusty explained, &#x201c;When I look at him I see what I could&#x2019;ve been. The Comanches stole me once, just like him. If the Lord hadn&#x2019;t been lookin&#x2019; my way, I&#x2019;d be Comanche now myself. Or dead.&#x201d;<br>Rusty sipped with pleasure the mixture of bad coffee and bad whiskey. &#x201c;Andy&#x2019;s got a long, twisty road ...</p><h2>The Mummy with No Name (Geronimo Stilton #26)</h2><p>Enter the world of Geronimo Stilton, where another funny adventure is always right around the corner.

By the author of Donadieu&#39;s Will.</p><p>First published in French in 1945, the late Simenon's small gem of a novel is the claustrophobic tale of a solitary, unbalanced Parisian woman who lives vicariously through her neighbors, on whom she spies obsessively. Dominique watches through the shutters as one sick neighbor dies just after his wife is late in giving him medicine. Dominique weaves fantasies around the widow, her domineering mother-in-law and her secret mulatto lover, sending her anonymous notes that read, "You killed your husband." Dominique's other obsession is her tenants, a young couple whose lovemaking she observes through a keyhole. These newlyweds occupy the room where Dominique had tended to her invalid, hard-drinking father, a retired general who died seven years earlier. Simenon posits Dominique's existence as a paradigm of the life unlived: "a brief, unconscious childhood, a short adolescence, then emptiness, tangles of troubles . . . and then, so soon, at forty, the feeling of being old. . . ." He invests Dominique with an unshakable dignity even as he probes her existential failure as one for whom the past and her fantasy life count at least as much as the present. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.One of Simenon's penetrating psychological studies (Donadieu's Will, etc.), first published in 1945 in France. It examines the barren, impoverished life of Dominique, a general's gently bred daughter, now 40, who had nursed her demanding father in his last years. Through a relative's charity, she occupies a Paris apartment, part of which she rents to the Cailles, a young married couple. Her meager assets allow for no frivolity, and her days are spent doing mundane chores; spying, shamefaced, on her vibrant tenants; and, through her window, watching the life of the Rouets in the apartment opposite. The elder Madame Rouet is endlessly at war with her sickly son's vivacious wife Antoinette. Dominique is a secret witness to the son's dramatic death and to Antoinette's ensuing struggles to escape the stifling household. What happens when Antoinette finally moves out and the Cailles leave for larger quarters carries an air of inevitability.... A somber story marked by the author's acute perceptions of human nature and his lean, elegant writing style. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The book follows one alligator through the month of October, a crucial time when drying rivers send animals to the Everglades alligators' deeper holes. The creature's hunger as it waits for food provides the thread around which George weaves information about its lifestyle as well as its importance to Everglades ecology. Name dropping of flora and fauna will challenge readers to check field guides as there is no glossary. George's flowing, nonanthropomorphic text evokes the dense green, seeping ecosystem illustrated in Rothman's realistic gouache paintings.

Now meet a heroine to match Scarlett: Courtenay Ross, a feisty, independent-minded woman, and the two men -- one a cool-headed, well-heeled gentleman, the other a hot-blooded, pugnacious sailor -- who adore her. A tale of yearning, valor, and devotion, Lost Laysen enthralls from its delightful beginning to its unforgettable end.<p>Equally intriguing is the story behind the story -- the real-life romance that inspired Mitchell: how she gave the original manuscript as a gift to her beau. Henry Love Angel, and how the manuscript, along with Mitchell's intimate letters and treasured photographs, were lovingly safeguarded only to be discovered decades later in a shoebox!</p><p>Lost Laysen is pure magic, a gift for us to cherish from America's most beloved storyteller.</p></p><p>Until 1995, <i>Gone with the Wind</i>--the 1937 Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the bestselling novel of all time--was the only published work of fiction credited to Margaret Mitchell. But 45 years after her death, the Road to Tara Museum unveiled what amounts to a national treasure--a novella written by America's most beloved storyteller. <i>Lost Laysen</i> is an exciting tale of love and honor on a South Pacific island. A rough-edged Irish boatsman is smitten with the feisty and independent Courtenay Ross. "Charley boy, I sure did love that little woman, I couldn't help it, tho I knew I never had a chance--she wasn't my kind. I wonder why it's always the little women that appeal to us big fellows?" Courtenay is engaged to a dapper young American who loves her so much, he follows her to the remote island of Laysen to persuade her to come home. What's so remarkable about this story is that Mitchell was just 16 when she put pen to paper and wrote the entire piece in less than a month's time.<p> Henry Love Angel, a close friend and likely admirer, was the recipient of the two notebooks in which the manuscript for <i>Lost Laysen</i> was written. It was Angel's grandson who discovered the amazing treasure that had been passed down to him--a box of photographs, negatives, correspondence from Mitchell to Angel, and the manuscript. "My dear--" begins one letter. "I was so proud of you, last time I saw you--proud of your love, your courage and resignation and most of all your self confidence. Don't let it drop my dear. I have prayed so hard that you would have it because without it you can never amount to much. With it and work, the world lies ahead. If ever you begin to get discouraged and lose confidence in your self--draw on my supply for I believe in you. Just set your mark and go to it." The never-before-seen photographs show Mitchell and a variety of friends goofing for the camera. This book provides charming insight into a brief period of Mitchell's life--one full of youthful folly, exuberance, and obvious joy.</p>This recently discovered tale of love in the South Pacific, published to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Gone with the Wind, was written when Mitchell was 16.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Yellowstone (Rivers West)</h2><p>Robert Burns MacLean, a trapper and mountain man, braves the dangers and hardships of the Great Northwest to forge a new future for himself in the wilderness</p><p>The native American Indians, the first pioneers, the family settlers--all who braved the emerging American West drew their very lived and fortunes from the great rivers.

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite Manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned Mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too. <p></p> <p>But Misselthwaite hides another secret, as mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin, Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic will work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>In the Wee Small Hours</h2><p><p>Life just keeps getting more complicated for Annie Baker. Her sister Lizzie's pregnant and wants Annie to be her birth-partner - she's planning an active labour, in water, with lots of candles and music. Her partner Matt isn't too sure, although he's bought some new swimming trunks just in case. Annie's friend Leila has got a new man, Tor, and she's getting heavily into yoga, while Kate from the village has somehow ended up having an affair with her own ex-husband. </p><p>And as for the men in Annie's own life, it just gets worse. Her seven-year-old son Charlie is now officially Pagan, and desperate for his own pet pheasant. Boss Barney is building a bit of a reputation for TV commercials involving stunts, so if she's not lurching around the North Sea in a trawler, she's stuck up a crane. Then there's Uncle Monty to keep an eye on, a retired mole-catcher who collects bric-a-brac. He's eighty-three and a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and has just threatened the Meals on Wheels lady with a shotgun and refuses to leave the farm where he's lived all his life. And as if all that wasn't difficult enough, Mack comes back from New York, just when Annie was beginning to think she might be able to cope without him �&#x20ac;� </p><p>For everyone who fell in love with Annie Baker and her <i>Only Boy for Me</i>, here's what happened next. And for anyone who's ever wondered how to combine motherhood, the country life and a career in town, and why pheasants make that weird clicking noise, this is essential reading.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Blood Bankers: Tales from the Global Underground Economy</h2><p>From 1970 to 2003, over three trillion dollars&#x2014;$3,000,000,000,000&#x2014;were loaned to developing countries by the West. Yet the gap between rich and poor is worse than ever. What happened? Where did all that money go? A financial insider, Jim Henry looks unsparingly at the snarl of transactions, often legal but usually immoral, that resulted in the rich getting richer and the poor, poorer. <p>Like tentacles on a vast octopus, the firsthand investigations in The Blood Bankers all lead to one core. A financial detective of sorts, journalist Jim Henry analyzes a range of scandals, including the looting of the Philippines by the Marcos family, corrupt lending in South America, and the financing of Al Qaeda. </p><p>A rogue's gallery of international criminals owes its existence to the dramatic growth of the underground global economy over the last two decades. Our world is being reshaped, often in sinister fashion, by wide-open capital markets and an international banking network that exists to launder hundreds of billions of dollars in ill-gotten gains. </p><p>Here is globalization's dark side&#x2014;the new high-growth global markets for influence-peddling, capital flight, money laundering, weapons, drugs, tax evasion, child labor, illegal immigration, and other forms of transnational crime.</p></p><p>Former Chief Economist for McKinsey &amp; Co. and VP Strategy for IBM/Lotus, James S.

He was at once a postmodern critical philosopher and a devout traditional Catholic, trying not only to reconcile these two seemingly disparate factors in his own mind, but also to prove to others that the two must go together. / In the first critical examination of the philosopher&#x2019;s life Oliva Blanchette tells the story of Blondel&#x2019;s stormy life confronting an Academy dismissive of religion and a Religion uncomfortable with rational philosophy. This book not only follows his biographical history, but also presents his systematic philosophy, from the beginning of his journey to the culmination found in Philosophical Exigencies of Christianity, the book for which he signed the publishing contract the day before he died. / Maurice Blondel is part of the Ressourcement: Retrieval and Renewal in Catholic Thought series, edited by David L.

From the kitchen to the studio and up those fateful Dakota steps, Sheff recorded 20 hours of tape, discussing everything from childhood to the Beatles.<br><br>Sheff gives a rare and last glimpse of John and Yoko, one that seemed to look beyond the kitchen table to the future of the world with startling premonitions of what was to come.<br></p><p>John Lennon could be angry, as he is in <i>Lennon Remembers: The Full Rolling Stone Interviews from 1970</i>, and nasty, as proven by Albert Goldman's brilliant, scathing <i>The Lives of John Lennon</i>. <p> But he could also be charming, smart, and extraordinarily witty, as he is in his last interview, published in book form as <i>All We Are Saying</i>. Co-interviewee Yoko Ono is charm-free but valuable, because she sparks the conversation and brings up fascinating stuff that Lennon wished she hadn't, like their mad plots to kidnap her daughter from her ex-husband. As interviewer David Sheff's tape rolls, John and Yoko's anecdotes flow effortlessly: the joys of making their 1980 comeback album, <i>Double Fantasy</i>; the mortifying horrors of John's "lost weekend" in L.A. with Harry Nilsson; John's interestingly twisted family life; John and Yoko and Paul's last get-together, watching <i>Saturday Night Live</i> the night producer Lorne Michaels offered the Beatles $3,200 to reunite on the show (they almost got in a cab and did it!). </p><p> Best of all is Lennon's song-by-song account of who wrote which famous tunes and where they came from. "Strawberry Fields" contains an entire childhood memoir, and the production reflects Paul's alleged "sabotage" of Lennon's work. "Please Please Me" was based on a Roy Orbison melody and Bing Crosby's punning song title "Please (Lend an Ear to My Pleas)." The "element'ry penguins" in "I Am the Walrus" refer to idiots like Allen Ginsberg who chant "Hare Krishna" worshipfully. "Hey Jude" was Paul's song comforting John's son Julian when John left his family for Yoko, and Paul's unconscious, reluctant farewell to his writing partner ("go out and get her"). </p><p> Lennon had been publicly silent and artistically dormant for five years before these interviews, and he was just bursting with the exhilaration of the rebirth of his imagination days before his death. Reading this book is like sharing a day in the life of a very happy man. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>David Sheff's articles and interviews have appeared in <i>Playboy, The New York Times Magazine, Rolling Stone, Wired, Outside, The Los Angeles Times Magazine, Esquire</i> and <i>Observer Magazine</i> in England, <i>Foreign Literature</i> in Russia and <i>Playboy (Shueisha)</i> in Japan.

Based on his own experience and extensive interviews with recognized key players, Grant's study begins with post-World War II Hanoi and hopscotches from Saigon to Washington to California, covering 30 years in an attempt to explain the personal actions and motives of Vietnamese and American officials. For a basic sketch of Phoenix and the CIA involvement in Vietnam, standard histories of the war suffice--e.g., Stanley Karnow's Vietnam ( LJ 10/1/83), John Ranelagh's The Agency: The Rise and Decline of the CIA ( LJ 6/1/86), Cecil B. Currey's Edward Lansdale: The Unquiet American (Houghton, 1989). Unique is the story of Tran Ngoc Chau, noted Vietnamese general and government official, who advocated a political rather than military solution to the war. Although the excess of personal and peripheral detail is distracting, Grant's energetic style and his analysis of little-publicized political controversies will hold the attention of casual or scholarly readers.

That&#x2019;s no accident: the book is designed like a desktop calendar in which each page tells you something new. Such as January 3, 1957, was the debut of the battery-powered watch, after more than a decade of development. And, on April 10, 1849, the safety pin was patented (revolutionizing, among many other things, the way babies&#x2019; diapers are changed). And, on October 31, 1951, pedestrian crossings were introduced in Britain (they call them zebra crossings due to their black-and-white stripes). Drawn from Wired magazine&#x2019;s blog This Day in Tech, this endlessly fascinating book is simply presented: each page contains a primary subject, a brief discussion of its history and importance, and one-sentence mentions of some other important things that happened on the same date. Its only drawback&#x2014;though no drawback at all for libraries&#x2014;is that, unlike a typical desktop calendar, you can&#x2019;t tear off one page when it&#x2019;s time to move on to the next. --David Pitt</p><h2>Stained Glass (Shire Library)</h2><p><p>For over a thousand years stories of Christian belief and great moments in British history have filled the windows of our cathedrals and parish churches.

He has written and directed some of the best plays in contemporary American theatre and three of his plays: <i>A Delicate Balance</i>, <i>Seascape</i> and <i>Three Tall Women</i> have received Pulitzer Prizes. His most famous play, <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Play. His other plays include <i>The Zoo Story, The Death of Bessie Smith, The Sandbox, The American Dream, Tiny Alice, All Over, Listening, The Lady from Dubuque, The Man Who Had Three Arms, Finding the Sun, Fragments, Marriage Play</i> and <i>The Lorca Play</i>.Albee's best plays have always walked a line between heightened realism and dark comedy. Even his most surreal works are populated with characters who wouldn't seem out of place in real life. His 1994 Pulitzer Prize winner runs true to form. It begins as a naturalistic conversation among three women (identified as A, B, and C) from successive generations who meet in a hospital room. Each is undergoing a change from one life phase to another, and each faces her travails and disappointments with lots of Albee's trademark bitter wit. In the second act, however, the three women become representatives of the same person at different ages (26, 52, late 80s), and their bickering talk becomes a touching internal colloquy about life, love, and the inevitability of loss. Not since Beckett's brooding meditation <i>Krapp's Last Tape</i> has a playwright dealt so movingly with the subject of disappointment, aging, and death. <i>Jack Helbig</i></p><h2>The Secret of the Beloved Disciple</h2><p>Follow the author on his worldwide adventures as he learns the mysterious identity of the Emissaries of Light, an ancient community of spiritual masters said to have existed for thousands of years.</p><p>James F.

Luna was curled into a ball, doing that thing she did when she wanted someone to believe she was still asleep: eyes scrunched too tightly closed, lips pulled down at the corners because Alex had told her once that she smiled when she faked sleep, so now she overcorrected.

He&#x2019;d been watching his grandmother long enough to know what to do. But it wouldn&#x2019;t be easy. Luna wasn&#x2019;t the kind of kid who just listened. Getting her to do anything took extensive negotiation, distraction, and occasionally&#x2014;�even with his grandmother&#x2014;�bribery.<br><br>Alex decided to skip straight to the bribery.<br><br>&#x201c;Too bad Luna&#x2019;s not awake, because I&#x2019;m about to have donuts for breakfast.&#x201d;<br><br>She pressed her face into the pillow to muffle a squeal and clamped her hands over her ears as if this might prevent their grandmother from hearing. It was breaking three rules, at least: (1) Stopping anywhere on the way to school, (2) Eating sugar before noon, and (3) Eating donuts, ever.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, she isn&#x2019;t here.&#x201d;<br><br>Luna peeled away from the pillow. Her brown eyes studied Alex, looking for clues as to how she should feel about this unfamiliar state of being. &#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;<br><br>He forced himself to smile. &#x201c;Mom took her to get Grandpa.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They found him?&#x201d;<br><br>Alex paused, then moved his head in a kind of circle, a motion that Luna would interpret as a yes but that was ambiguous enough to get Alex off if he was ever questioned for lying at the gates of heaven. He&#x2019;d hidden his grandmother&#x2019;s letter behind the tip jar his mother kept in the kitchen cabinet, which he&#x2019;d hoped would be full (she&#x2019;d taken most of the money, though, leaving only three inches of coins at the bottom of the jar) and estimated the time it would take for them to return by the miles to Oro de Hidalgo and back, calculated at seventy miles an hour. Best case scenario: &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be back on Friday.&#x201d;<br><br>Luna was quiet, and for a minute Alex thought she was worrying, as he was, about how his mother would get his grandparents, Maria Elena and Enrique, back across the border&#x2014;�or whether they would get back at all. But then she asked what day it was.<br><br>&#x201c;Tuesday.&#x201d;<br><br>She hummed the days of the week to the tune of &#x201c;Clementine&#x201d; and counted on her fingers. &#x201c;Three days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. Three days of eating whatever we want and staying after school with our friends.&#x201d;<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t have any friends; Luna did not look convinced.<br><br>He squeezed her feet through the blankets, trying to think of something to comfort her. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been alone before, remember?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded, fear in her eyes for the first time, and he realized too late that it was the wrong thing to say. They&#x2019;d both gotten stomachaches from the potatoes he&#x2019;d half-�baked, and she&#x2019;d cried, inconsolably, the whole night through. That time, Maria Elena hadn&#x2019;t meant to leave them alone. She and Enrique had gone out of town and hired a babysitter, but the girl got sick and left, and even though they&#x2019;d called Letty in a panic, she hadn&#x2019;t come home until six o&#x2019;clock in the morning.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m older now,&#x201d; he said and then, because he couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else to say: &#x201c;Sprinkles?&#x201d;<br><br>Luna studied him. &#x201c;Are we really going to get donuts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you ever get out of bed, we are.&#x201d; She reached out, and he pulled her up and set her on the floor. &#x201c;Need help?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nana said I could wear my heart dress. She said she&#x2019;d wash it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But she said.&#x201d;<br><br>It was exactly the kind of conversation that could spiral into hysteria; the recovery would take half the morning. &#x201c;Hold on.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked in the closet, where his grandmother hung the clothes she&#x2019;d ironed, and then in the kitchen sink, where she soaked things overnight; finally, he found it on the drying rack in the stairwell, stretched flat on top of a towel.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s wet,&#x201d; Luna said when he handed it to her.<br><br>&#x201c;So wear it wet, or wear something dry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I want to wear this. And I don&#x2019;t want it to be wet.&#x201d;<br><br>She held her dress by the sleeves and swung it around in a circle. The material flew just inches from his face. He reached out and grabbed it.<br><br>&#x201c;Stop that. Come here.&#x201d; From her dresser he found leggings and a long-�sleeved shirt, and dressed her in both before pulling the damp dress over her head. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t even tell it&#x2019;s wet.&#x201d;<br><br>Luna wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;But why are we even going to school?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Please, please, please, can we stay home and watch TV?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; Alex said. They were so different, he and his sister, that sometimes he couldn&#x2019;t believe they were even related. But then, Alex was different from just about everyone he&#x2019;d ever met. While the other eighth graders in his class read banned magazines behind textbooks and painted their nails under their desks and avoided answering questions, Alex came to school every day armed with some strange fact to shock or impress his teacher. Most of these facts he got from his grandfather, the only person he knew who was like him. Enrique could recite the name of every bird that traveled the Pacific Flyway in alphabetical order, a skill he&#x2019;d learned from his own father, and his grandfather before that. Alex had been able to do it for as long as he could remember.<br><br>Grabbing his clothes from the closet, he went to the bathroom to get dressed. Behind the locked door he pulled on the white shirt his grandmother had ironed. The kids at Cesar Chavez called him &#x201c;Newsman&#x201d; because of his shirts, but Alex knew he looked nothing like a television reporter. He was too skinny, for one, and his nose had grown before the rest of his face. But the real problem with Alex&#x2019;s appearance was his hair: a wavy, almost-�blond mop he assumed he&#x2019;d inherited from his father. Alex had never seen him, but in a shoe box under Letty&#x2019;s bed was a sealed envelope addressed to Wes Riley, 536 Elm Street, Mission Hills, California. When he&#x2019;d searched the name on his school computer, Alex had found images of a man who looked almost exactly like him&#x2014;�blue eyes, milky skin, and a square jaw. In every photograph he wore scrubs and held a different dark-�skinned baby. The captions read &#x201c;Mumbai,&#x201d; &#x201c;Malawi,&#x201d; &#x201c;Guatemala City.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been given some kind of award in 2005, but the article about it was written in an African language Alex didn&#x2019;t recognize and couldn&#x2019;t understand.<br><br>But of all the information he&#x2019;d gathered about his father, the address was the thing that most captivated him. It was just over the freeway. For years, Alex had imagined walking past the house, his father recognizing him from the window and rushing out. He&#x2019;d never gotten far enough from Maria Elena&#x2019;s watchful eye to venture there alone, though, and he&#x2019;d never summoned the courage to ask his mother about the man or the circumstances of his birth&#x2014;�mostly because he&#x2019;d never summoned the courage to ask his mother about anything at all.<br><br>He brushed his teeth quickly as Luna pounded on the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Alex! Let me in.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>Maria Elena had packed their lunches for the week and stacked them on the top shelf of the refrigerator, all labeled. alex: tuesday, luna: tuesday, and behind those the Wednesdays, the Thursdays, and the Fridays. Below their lunches were the remnants of every meal their grandmother had made for the last two weeks, stored and dated and&#x2014;�Alex could imagine the smell without cracking open the lids&#x2014;�many edging toward decay. He pulled out the Tuesday lunches and stuffed them in their backpacks, checking to see that their tennis shoes were still at the bottoms of the bags, where they belonged.<br><br>From the bathroom, he heard the toilet flush and the faucet turn on and off, and then Luna stood in the doorway. Water dripped onto her forehead, from where she&#x2019;d slicked the loose hair back into her braids. If her teacher ever noticed anything, she would notice that Luna&#x2019;s hair had not been rebraided that morning for the very first time all year. But Luna was the least of her teacher&#x2019;s problems&#x2014;�she probably wouldn&#x2019;t even look at her the entire day.<br><br>Fishing through the tip jar, Alex extracted a stack of quarters and stepped into his rain boots. He handed Luna hers: knee-�high with pink polka dots. They were the one item of clothing necessary to survive life at the Landing, and the one thing his grandmother did not buy generic. Luna pulled them on.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still there, did you see?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is?&#x201d;<br><br>She gestured for him to follow. In their grandparents&#x2019; room, the bed was made as it always was, the quilt pulled tight and square, but he saw immediately that things were different. Only a nail remained where a small cross had hung over the bed; the top of his grandmother&#x2019;s dresser was empty of photographs and glistened with some kind of polish. Alex imagined her dusting while she packed. Luna pulled him across the room to where his grandfather&#x2019;s workbench sat under the window, his most recent project spread out exactly as he&#x2019;d left it.<br><br>For six months, their grandfather had been focused on a single feather mosaic, a landscape of a rural village in Mexico, with small stucco houses tilting in imperfect rows and a shawl-�wrapped woman looking up at a full moon. It was only the profile of the woman, and she was young, but Alex could tell it was his grandmother. It was always his grandmother. The feather work was so fine that from a few feet away it could be mistaken for an oil painting, each feather a single stroke, but instead the mosaic was created entirely of naturally occurring feathers stuck into a thin layer of campeche wax. The smell of wax hung heavy in the air, and it made him miss his grandfather intensely: the way he patted his thighs every time Alex stepped into the room, even after Alex grew too big to sit in his lap; the way he stopped everything to stand up and look outside, narrating the natural world for his grandson, who remembered every word he said.<br><br>Enrique had been gone for six weeks, returning to Mexico to be with his dying mother, and now Maria Elena and Letty were gone too. Alex moved to the window and looked out at the empty landscape.<br><br>They were completely alone.<br><br>More alone than seemed reasonable, given that they stood less than twenty miles south of San Francisco. Most of the time he didn&#x2019;t notice the isolation, or else he tried to think about only the good things: the birds, the view, the water. But every once in a while it hit him. Where was civilization? Outside, Mile Road stretched through the empty marsh, from Highway 101 to the edge of the bay, ending at the three squat buildings of Eden&#x2019;s Landing: Building A, painted an industrial peachy brown; Building B, half a shade darker of the same dull color; and Building C, closest to the water and painted a faded robin&#x2019;s-�egg blue. A barbed-�wire fence separated the Landing from the San Francisco International Airport to the north; nothing but a stretch of ever-�shifting wetlands separated it from the bankrupt blight of Bayshore to the south. There were other towns nearby, nice ones like Hillsborough and Burlingame and San Mateo, but the expansion of the 101 freeway had cut off the Landing and Bayshore from the rest of the peninsula. Alex could see Mission Hills, the most affluent of the suburbs, directly across the freeway from where he stood&#x2014;�but it felt like a world away.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll come back. Won&#x2019;t he?&#x201d; Luna asked, interrupting his thoughts. She was studying her grandfather&#x2019;s mosaic. In a ring around the full moon the wax showed through, chocolate-�colored and sticky; beside it, blue-�black feathers poked from the top of a labeled envelope as if waiting for his return.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course he will,&#x201d; Alex said.<br><br>But he wasn&#x2019;t sure.<br><br>Just before his grandfather left, Alex had complained that they didn&#x2019;t have even one piece of Enrique&#x2019;s work. He&#x2019;d been sitting beside him at his workbench, as he did every day after school, separating the striped from the solid feathers of a marsh wren. Enrique had nodded solemnly but hadn&#x2019;t said anything, and now he was gone.<br><br>Perhaps he&#x2019;d left the mosaic for them on purpose, Alex thought: a silent apology for his sudden flight.</p><h2>The Best Place</h2><p>The old wolf likes his house. He likes his neighbors. But he loves his screened in porch. From there he can watch the beautiful sunset. He can be outside when it rains and never get wet. The mosquitoes can&#39;t bite him on his screened in porch, and even on the hottest summer nights there is always a breeze. The wolf thinks his porch is the best place in the world until one day his friend Bird says, &#34;How do you know? You&#39;ve never been anyplace else.&#34; This question inspires the wolf to sell his house and travel the world. Eventually his journey brings him back home, but he is unable to get his house back. Upset, he behaves very badly, and even his good intentions get him into trouble. But in the end he understands that sometimes when you can&#39;t get what you want, you find something even better.</p><p>Susan Meddaugh was born and raised in Montclair, New Jersey. She graduated from Wheaton College, where she studied French literature and fine arts. After working briefly with an advertising agency in New York, she moved to Boston and worked at a publishing company for ten years, first as a designer, then art editor, and finally as art director. While there, she did the illustrations for GOOD STONES (Houghton Mifflin) by Anne Epstein, and then decided to strike out on her own as a freelance illustrator and creator of children&#39;s books. Since that time, Susan has written and illustrated many popular books for children, including MARTHA SPEAKS, which was chosen as a NEW YORK TIMES Best Illustrated Book for 1992. In 1998 she was awarded the New England Book Award, given by the New England Booksellers Association to recognize a body of work. Her work also was acknowledged with a New York Times Best Illustrated Award. She lives in Sherborn, Massachusetts."Meddaugh combines understated humor with her expressive watercolor illustrations to produce a delightful book." School Library Journal, Starred<br><br>"A wolf loves to sit on his screened porch watching the world go by until he realizes that when he calls his porch the best place in the world, he has no basis for comparison. He sells his house to a rabbit family and begins traveling. Now he has a basis for comparison: the outside world has mosquitoes, hot sandy deserts, and rain. So he goes home, but the rabbits don't want to sell. He throws a temper tantrum, and suddenly his neighbors realize what big teeth he has. Ashamed, he tries to prepare his neighbors' dinner, but the animals think dinner is to be them and rout the wolf. The misunderstanding is resolved, and the wolf, who has climbed a tree, finds a new "best place" and builds a tree house--to which his animal friends are always invited. The story meanders a bit, but Meddaugh's pen-and-watercolor artwork is clever as usual. The focus is on the quixotic wolf, and the pictures are at their best as the wolf tries to put up with the vagaries of travel. Not as fresh as some of Meddaugh's books, but fun nonetheless." Booklist, ALA<br><br>Could it be that the grass really is greener on the other side of the porch? The wolf dearly loves his cozy screened-in sanctuary, but a seed of doubt planted by his friend, a bird who has seen more of the world, leads him to sell his house, pack his bags, and go searching for an even more idyllic spot. Humorous drawings capture the wolf's expressive reactions to his disappointing experiences, along with his frustration and wistfulness when he discovers that he can't go home; the rabbits love his old house too much to sell it back, even at twice the price. Several misunderstandings ensue before the wolf finds a perfect perch, and a way to make amends with his neighbors. Meddaugh (Martha Walks the Dog, 1998, etc.) tells a funny tale, with lesson that even young listeners will appreciate; the story's surprising twists and unpredictable outcome will make children turn to this one again.<br>Kirkus Reviews</p><h2>Jack and the Beanstalk</h2><p><p><strong>A favorite fairy tale brought vividly to life by Steven Kellogg's elaborate, classic artwork</strong><strong>&#x2014;perfect for a read-aloud pick!</strong> </p><p>Join young Jack as he climbs a giant beanstalk to a magic castle in the clouds.

The action starts as soon as Humberto leaves the house, and doesn&#39;t stop until he and his buddies have been shocked, scared, gassed, gored, trampled and battered into submission.</p><p>New Orleans journalist Fontova has covered diving, hunting and fishing for specialty magazines like Bowhunter, Scuba Times and Sierra and penned a book about divers who spear fish from oil rigs (Helldivers' Rodeo) two years ago. Now the hellbent author and his equally hellbent pals are back, intent on stirring up more nonstop macho action. This time they hope to nail a wild pig during a Louisiana bayou "hunting-fishing-boozing trip." The pig chase doesn't begin until page 173, but no matter. The fun is getting there. Amid their "orgy of blood-lust, booze, and lechery; a three-day indulgence of our primal passions in primitive splendor," readers get fascinating factoids of Louisiana lore, ecology, geology, history, politics and wildlife, plus literary, cinematic and pop culture references. Navigating the French Quarter and the Mississippi Delta's shallow marshes and squishy mudflats, Fontova and company encounter gators and girls gone wild, "plumb, freakin' crazy" hog hunters, migrating waterfowl, mosquitoes and snakes. Fun comes as the gang razzes a greenhorn businessman along for the hunt: "I explained to him that we cut more business deals in hunting and fishing camps than on any golf course, but probably just as many in titty bars." Memoir adds to the madhouse mix, with Fontova's flashbacks erupting in an onslaught of anecdotes. Fontova's voice is powerful and compelling, and the hog hunt finale is worth the wait. The end result is something like Deliverance as written by Hunter Thompson.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Best Plays of the Early American Theater</h2><p><p>During early colonial times, traveling actors and troupes from London took the first tentative steps in establishing America's theatrical tradition. The nation's history of theater evolved slowly, but the nineteenth-century development of an authentic American theatrical voice gave rise to a growing number of noteworthy indigenous playwrights by the early 1900s. This carefully edited volume charts the progress of the American theater between 1787 and 1911, with a chronological selection of 16 of the best works from that period:<br><i>The Contrast,</i> Royall Tyler (1787)<br><i>Superstition, </i>James N. Barker (1824)<br><i>Charles the Second,</i> John Howard Payne and Washington Irving (1824)<br><i>Fashion,</i> Anna Cora Mowatt (1845)<br><i>Uncle Tom's Cabin,</i> George L. Aiken (1852)<br><i>The Octoroon,</i> Dion Boucicault (1859)<br><i>The Count of Monte Cristo,</i> Charles Fechter (1883)<br><i>The Mouse-Trap,</i> William Dean Howells (1889)<br><i>Secret Service,</i> William Gillette (1896)<br><i>The Great Divide,</i> William Vaughn Moody (1906)<br><i>The New York Idea,</i> Langdon Mitchell (1906)<br><i>The Truth, </i>Clyde Fitch (1907)<br><i>The Witching Hour,</i> Augustus Thomas (1907)<br><i>Salvation Nell,</i> Edward Sheldon (1908)<br><i>The Easiest Way,</i> Eugene Walter (1909)<br><i>The Scarecrow,</i> Percy MacKaye (1911)<br>Representative rather than comprehensive, this highly readable volume combines familiar but historically important plays with less well-known pieces for a fascinating introduction to early American drama.<br>Note: As all these plays are copyright-free, they can be performed without fee or permission by professional and amateur groups.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Henry Reed&#39;s Journey</h2><p>The journal from Henry&#39;s trip across the country with the Glass family, telling of the sights they saw and the strange things which resulted when Henry and Midge became involved in innocent and blameless goings-on.</p><p>Robert McCloskey (1914-2003) wrote and illustrated some of the most honored and enduring children's books ever published.

A leading figure in the Indian Space painting movement of the late 1940s, Barnet stressed the spatial structures of Northwest Coast Indian art. Throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s, he made a series of hardedged, totemic abstractions marked by their "all-positive" space, which he described as austere, classical expressions of Indian culture. He then moved on to new art forms in the 1960s and 1970s, creating a series of family and art world portraits that achieved a remarkable balance between the formal demands of abstraction and the humanist aspects of representation. </p><p> Will Barnet: A Timeless World is the first substantial publications to unify Barnet's prodigious output. Art historian Gail Stavitsky provides an overview of this artist's entire career. Twig Johnson, the museum's curator of Native American Art, discusses the relationship of Barnet's work to this important indigenous artistic tradition. Jessica Nicoll, chief curator at the Portland Museum of Art, explores the profound impact of New England upon Barnet and his work. Many of Barnet's works are beautifully reproduced in this catalog, containing 43 color and 20 black-and-white illustrations. </p></p><p></p><h2>In Honor Bound</h2><p>British SAS agent Barney Crispin enters Soviet-occupied Afghanistan to avenge the deaths of fourteen British-trained mujahidin and to obtain information on the new Soviet helicopter gunships</p><p></p><h2>Seek First His Kingdom</h2><p>An anthology of excerpts from the Saint&#39;s sermons.</p><p></p><h2>Fire This Time: The Watts Uprising and the 1960s (Carter G.

He documents the role of the Cold War in the dismantling of legalized segregation, and he looks at the impact of race, religion, class, gender, and age on postwar Los Angeles.</p></p><p><p>Gerald Horne, presently a Fulbright Scholar in the Department of History of the University of Zimbabwe, teaches at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

It is twenty years since the death of Rebecca, the hauntingly beautiful first wife of Maxim de Winter. It is twenty years since the inquest, which famously -- and controversially -- passed a verdict of suicide. Twenty years since Manderley, the de Winters' ancient family seat, was razed to the ground.</p><p>But Rebecca's tale is just beginning.</p><p>Family friend Colonel Julyan receives an anonymous parcel in the post. It contains a black notebook with two handwritten words on the first page -- Rebecca's Tale -- and two pictures: a photograph of Rebecca as a young child and a postcard of Manderley.</p><p>A mysterious young scholar by the name of Terence Gray has also appeared in town, looking for clues to Rebecca's life and death. His presence causes a stir in the quiet hamlet, and the tongues that had wagged about Rebecca years before now attend to the close ties Gray has formed to the Colonel and his single daughter, Ellie.</p><p>Amid the intrigues of this small coastal town, Ellie, Gray, and the Colonel begin a search for the real Rebecca. Was she the manipulative, promiscuous femme fatale her husband claimed, or the Gothic heroine of tragic proportions that others have suggested? Was her death really suicide, or was it murder?</p><p>Sally Beauman has taken Daphne du Maurier's celebrated twentieth-century classic, Rebecca, and crafted a compelling companion for the twenty-first century. Haunting, evocative, mesmerizing, <em>Rebecca's Tale</em> is for anyone who has ever dreamed of going back to Manderley.</p></p><p><p>Sally Beauman is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and journalist who began her career at <em>New York</em> magazine. Her internationally bestselling novels, including <em>Rebecca's Tale</em>, her sequel to Daphne du Maurier's iconic work, have been translated into more than twenty languages. She has written for <em>The New Yorker</em>, the <em>Sunday Times</em>, and numerous other leading periodicals on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>Does Miriam Margolyes ever give a bad performance? Margolyes breathes a bit of life into this predictable novel by Sally Beauman, lending a different voice to each character in its quiet seaside setting. But even Margolyes's great ability isn't enough to overcome the slow start to this story or the predictable melodrama that unfolds. Margolyes perfectly captures the mean spirit and drama behind Rebecca, the novel's focus, but the result is the listener's strong dislike for most of the characters involved. One wonders if the abridgment cut out any redeeming qualities of Rebecca and those around her. While Margolyes makes the story somewhat enjoyable with her talent for reading, it isn't enough to warrant a replay.

Once labeled &#x2018;boring&#x2019;, the region is now being radically reappraised. Emma Thomson introduces travelers not only to the World Heritage Sites of Brussels&#x2019; Grand Place or Bruges&#x2019; romantic canals, but also to snug off-the-beaten-track spots, like the bewitched village of Laarne, and Geraardsbergen &#x2013; the real home of Manneken-Pis. <i>Flanders</i> has something for everyone: the business tourist; the wildlife and outdoor enthusiast; the traveler wanting to eke out villages; and the visitor who fancies a bit of luxury and pampering.</p></p><p>Emma Thomson was formerly Commissioning Editor at Bradt Travel Guides and now works as a freelance writer and photographer.

With persistence and an odd tenderness, he explores the psychic wounds of silence and suppression. <i>Legacy of Silence</i> is a journey as much as a study. Bar-On traveled with personal trepidation and on a dangerous intellectual borderline. (Richard Eder <i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br><i>Legacy of Silence</i> is a record of Bar-On's interviews with the (now adult) children of men who ranged from minor functionaries of the Holocaust to serious mass-murderers...This account probably comes as close to total honesty as it is humanly possible to achieve. And such is [Bar-On's] skill as an interviewer that one feels his partners in dialogue have likewise reached the limits of bearable insight into the mentality of their elders. (John C. Marshall <i>Nature</i>)<br><br>The strength of the book is the way in which he shares his own self-discovery with that of his interviewees, many of whom had not had the chance to think and talk systematically about their guilty parents before the interviews. The book is particularly interesting in light of the recent <i>Historikerstreit</i> in Germany and the bitter controversy about the uniqueness or otherwise of the Holocaust. Bar-On is light-years removed from any attempt to minimize the Final Solution...The humanity of this study is not the least of its virtues.

In this fascinating novel, one of the masters of impossible crime fiction takes on one of the greatest criminals of all time. Sticking scrupulously to the facts, Paul Halter explores the Jack the Ripper murders and offers his own theories about the identity of the monster, what drove him, and how he was able to vanish under the noses of the police during the spree of escalating horror which sent the citizens of fog-ridden London into paroxysms of fear in the autumn of 1888.. But the year before &#x201c;Saucy Jacky&#x201d; began his reign of terror, someone started to investigate an astonishing impossible murder committed in the country village of Blackfield nine years earlier. That, too, involved a monstrous murderer who slaughtered witnesses and vanished under the noses of his pursuers. Is there a connection with the Ripper cases which followed? Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly named The Crimson Fog as one of the Top Mysteries of 2013, awarding it a starred review on October 4, 2013: &#x2018;First published in France in 1988, this brilliant fair-play mystery from impossible crime master Halter (The Seventh Hypothesis) showcases his ingenuity at misdirecting the reader and his unique approach to the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888. In the first part, set in 1887, an openly unreliable narrator, Sidney Miles, returns to his hometown of Blackfield in disguise to solve a murder that &#x201c;no one, absolutely no one, could have committed.&#x201d; The stabbing death of Richard Morstan as he was preparing a magic trick behind a curtain has spawned legends of a phantom killer. Miles&#x2019;s inquiries stir the pot, and other baffling murders follow. This section sets the stage for a suspenseful and historically accurate retelling of the Whitechapel slayings that focuses on the killer&#x2019;s seemingly supernatural ability to disappear after committing his butcheries. As in the best whodunits, the solution is both logical and surprising. Golden Age fans encountering Halter for the first time will want to seek out his other, equally artful puzzles.&#x2019; Paul Halter, who has been fascinated by Jack the Ripper from a tender age, won the coveted French Prix du Roman d&#x2019;Aventures in 1988 and the prestigious Japanese Hunkaku Mystery Award 2005 for Le Brouillard Rouge (The Crimson Fog).

Disappointed with the lack of travel, he left the military and, for a while, sold life insurance while augmenting his income playing the guitar in the local dance orchestra. Upon discovering the writings of John Dickson Carr, he gave up the guitar for the pen. He has since written over 30 novels, almost all &#x201c;locked room,&#x201d; including La Quatrieme Porte (The Fourth Door,) which won the Prix du Roman Policier in 1987, and Le Brouillard Rouge (The Crimson Fog,) which won the coveted French Prix du Roman d&#x2019;Aventures in 1988, the prestigious Japanese Hunkaku Mystery Award in 2005, and was named as one of the Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly Top Mysteries of 2013.

Luther&#39;s theology--his view of language and understanding of creation, incarnation, the cross; his affirmation of freedom from ecclesial, economic, and/or political encroachments; his eschatology, and so forth--is seen in a new light in societies in which modernization does not necessarily mean secularization and the spirit is not set in dual opposition to things material. The dispute as to whether Luther is a late medieval theologian or a beacon of modernity is rendered largely superfluous when the Reformer is read and interpreted in contexts that do not share the peculiar cultural and political history of Europe, its orthodoxies, its pietisms, its enlightenments, and its secularisms. Transfiguring Luther lifts up and presents the significance of the Reformer--his figure as it is transfigured into diverse contexts, absorbing new contents instead of the traditional bastions that are remarkably in tune with the spirit of the Reformation, thus rekindling it.</p><p>V�tor Westhelle is professor of Systematic Theology at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago and the chair of Luther Research at Faculdades EST, S�o Leopoldo, Brazil. He is a gifted teacher with the soul of a poet adept at playing different keys of the theological ivories. A well-known author and internationally sought-out speaker, Westhelle&#39;s writings on Luther, liberation, creation, the apocalyptic, postcolonialism, hybridity, and eschatology are widely acclaimed.&#x2018;[I]t is of great importance for anyone wanting to understand world Lutheranism, and in particular, questions concerning social justice and liberation theology now being addressed by Lutherans in the global South to their communion as a whole.... This is a book full of interesting insights into Luther, well worth reading and re-reading by newcomers to Luther and those already knowledgeable about his life and teaching. It deserves careful attention both by Lutherans and other Christians concerned to learn from them.&#x2019; (David Carter <i>The Window, 2017</i>)</p><h2>In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer: Transcript of hearing before personnel security board and texts of principal documents and letters</h2><p>This publication brings back into print the complete testimony, as released by the AEC in 1954, of the hearing called to determine if Oppenheimer was a "security risk." But the importance of the document goes far beyond the considered question of whether to terminate his security clearance: The testimony spans Oppenheimer's personal life from the 1920s to the 1950s, reflects the broader political and scientific stirrings of this period, and raises issues that remain central today. The document develops all these themes&#x2014;it is a compelling human portrait, an eyewitness history of some of the most important events of the century, and a flashback to one of the points of origin of our present concerns with the arms race and government decision making, conscientious dissent and national loyalty.<br> <br> The testimony is inherently dramatic (as a recent play of the same title has shown). In the title role, Oppenheimer reveals himself as a man of Hamletlike complexity, by turns humble and arrogant, na�ve and knowing, candid and reserved, witty and deadly serious. His final greatness makes itself felt in that joining of resignation to resolution with which he accepts the adverse outcome of his case (to him, inevitable) and its tragic implications for the nation.<br> <br> As background, the testimony carries the reader through a number of settings: the revolution in physics of the late 1920s; the depression, the rise of Nazism, the Spanish Civil War, and the American left's fascination with another sort of revolution; the war years, the building of the atomic bomb, and the decision to use it; the simultaneous opening of the U.N. and the Cold War, and the failure to bring atomic weapons under international control; and the heyday of McCarthyism with its patriotic hysteria, suspicion, and repression.<br> <br> The abiding pertinence of this document is obvious. It is addressed to a nation loudly debating ABM and MIRV deployment, leftist politics, military-industrial-governmental power, the question of loyalty, the limits of dissent, and the right of a man to define for himself, in conscience, what the "national interest" is or should be, as Oppenheimer did in opposing the creation of the hydrogen bomb.<br> <br> Among those called to give witness in these matters are Fermi, von Neumann, Bethe, DuBridge, Rabi, Teller, Gen, Groves, McCloy, Lilienthal, Karl Compton, Bush, and Conant. For the first time, the transcript has been provided with an index.</p><p></p><h2>Science Arts: Discovering Science Through Art Experiences (Bright Ideas for Learning (TM))</h2><p>Children explore the world of science through art with these open-ended experiments categorized by scientific topic.

"Passion Killers" will make your toes curl for the hapless Mrs Palmer, and "The Odstock Curse" may well induce goosebumps as a Gypsy curse is repeated in the present. Among the fifteen tales are two featuring Peter Lovesey's forthright police detective, Peter Diamond, and two with the amateur sleuth, Bertie, Prince of Wales, in rumbustious form. The collection also include "The Pushover," winner of the Mystery Writers of America's Golden Mysteries short story prize, and "Quiet Please&#x2014;We're Rolling," both nominated for Britain's Crime Writer's Association Short Story Dagger. <p>Do Not Exceed the Stated Dose includes a complete checklist of Peter Lovesey's crime writing.</p></p><p>Julian Symons wrote that &#34;Lovesey&#39;s ingenuity and readiness to experiment have been manifested most successfully in a collection of marvellously clever short stories.&#34; Peter Lovesey, a past chairman of the Crime Writer&#39;s Association, has won honors around the world, including the Gold and Silver Daggers, the Macavity, and the Grand Prix de Litterature Polici�re.The perfect tonic for fans and an introductory prescription for others. -- <i>Publishers Weekl;y, February 9, 1998 </i><br><br>This outstanding collection of short mysteries by the always appealing Peter Lovesey offers variety, humor, suspense, and clever plotting. -- <i>Booklist, March 1, 1998 </i><br><br>You'll be tempted to ignore the author's advice to read only one or two at a sitting. -- <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, January 1999</i></p><h2>The Mirror &amp; the Mask: Portraiture in the Age of Picasso</h2><p>The Mirror and the Mask: Portraiture in the Age of Picasso</p><p></p><h2>Badger&#39;s Moon</h2><p><p><strong>Super sleuth Sister Fidelma returns in BADGER'S MOON, the thirteenth historical mystery by Peter Tremayne, acclaimed author THE HAUNTED ABBOT, SMOKE IN THE WIND and many more.</strong></p><p><strong>PRAISE FOR THE SISTER FIDELMA SERIES: 'Rich helpings of evil and tension with lively and varied characters'<i>Historical Novels Review,</i>'The detail of the books is fascinating, giving us a vivid picture of everyday life at this time'<i>Irish Examiner</i></strong></p><p>A series of horrific murders has brought terror to the Kingdom of Muman.

Low hanging, remorselessly bright and cold, it filled the heavens with such luminosity that all darkness seemed to vanish. He felt visible and naked before it, standing shivering in its unmerciful icy illumination. Some distant thought registered that it was curious, in spite of a feeling of body coldness, that his head appeared to be on fire, the palms of his hands were sweating, and his breathing was swift and shallow. He felt almost sexually aroused. His heartbeat was throbbing in excitement. His nostrils were filled with the fragrance of the mixed nocturnal scents. He raised his arms towards the giant smudged white disc, stretching forth his fingertips as if he would pluck the moon from the sky, straining forward a little, the muscles rippling in his back and shoulders as he stretched.</p><p>His lips drew back from his teeth, snarling a little in his grin of exultation. He felt a thrill of knowledge, an intoxication of superiority over his fellows. He, alone of all people, would dare to speak the forbidden sacred name of the moon because he shared her enlightenment, her secret wisdom. He, alone, dared speak her name while his fellows would call her by myriad euphemisms and epithets because they were too frightened to stand before the unforgiving goddess of the night and utter her true, hallowed identity. They would uneasily refer to her as &#x2018;the brightness&#x2019;, &#x2018;the radiance&#x2019;, or &#x2018;the place where knowledge is gathered&#x2019;, and when sailors went on board a ship they thought they would bring misfortune on themselves unless they simply called her &#x2018;Queen of the Night&#x2019;. But he knew her true name and only he would dare to utter it.</p><p>Only he had the privilege of pronouncing her name, and it was a token of his power, a show of his authority and skill in defining the named. The God of the New Faith would not reveal his own name even to his beloved Moses. Didn&#x2019;t the priests of the New Faith say that when Moses asked for the name of the deity who was about to use him, the God replied: &#x2018;I am who I am.&#x2019; Was it not true that all the gods wanted to declare their divine freedom from any manipulation or control by concealing the knowledge and use of their names? Names and naming imparted power. He held that power. He felt that power now.</p><p>He stretched forth his hands again and spread his fingertips as if to caress the stern, smutty face of the moon.</p><p>He could feel that stirring, the strange pulsating of the sreang na imleac�in, the umbilical cord, which bound him to her white orb and demanded his unquestioning service and obedience, in return for which he held dominion beneath her rays.</p><p>He knew that the time had come once again when he could no longer resist her demands. The compulsion was now irresistible.</p><p>He turned from the clearing and moved into the woods with a curious loping gait. He knew where he was going although he had not consciously worked it out. He carried himself with an animal-like ease, moving swiftly along the darkened forest path. He negotiated its impediments without difficulty, his breath soft and not taxed at all by his efforts. The main track was near. The trees were thinning and he could see the dark outlines of the old rath of the chieftain on the hill to his right. He paused at the sight. He observed the flicker of the lanterns that marked the gates of the fortress. He knew that in the shadows behind the lamps there would be at least two warriors on watch. That did not matter. He did not intend to go any closer to the fortress than he was now. That was not his purpose.</p><p>The moonlight revealed that the track, which lay alongside the woods, winding its way up to the fortress, was deserted. He glanced up at the orb above him and his lips compressed momentarily into a thin determined line.</p><p>Was it too late? Could he have missed the moment? Surely not. The impulse which guided him assured him that all would be right. He had the knowledge. He was omniscient.</p><p>There was a movement at the gates of the rath. The squeal of metal hinges disturbed the silence of the night. He could hear voices and someone called in a masculine drawl: &#x2018;Safe home, Ballgel!&#x2019; A soft female voice answered cheerfully. Then he heard the rasping sound of the gates shutting.</p><p>A shadowy figure began to swing down the hill.</p><p>He let out a breath of thanks. He had arrived in time. The slight female figure, apparently carrying a basket on one arm, became visible in the moonlight once away from the dark shadows of the fortress walls. The figure walked with a confident youthful step.</p><p>He smiled to himself and drew back a little into the cover of the trees. He could feel the throb of his pulse begin to increase its pressure again, the sweat on the palms of his hands began to itch. Unconsciously he rubbed them up and down on his thighs to dry them and ease the itching sensation.</p><p>The figure drew nearer, walking swiftly, unconcerned. The girl drew abreast of him and he moved slightly, causing the undergrowth to rustle gently.</p><p>She halted at once and swung in his direction.</p><p>&#x2018;Who is there?&#x2019; she demanded, peering into the darkness, her voice showing no fear.</p><p>He hesitated only a moment, peering swiftly around in the shadows to make sure that they were alone, and then stepped forward into the moonlight. She recognised him and visibly relaxed.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, so it&#x2019;s you! What are you doing here?&#x2019;</p><p>He cleared his dry throat and forced a smile. His voice was pitched to that of warm friendliness. &#x2018;I was on my way home, Ballgel. I thought I saw you coming down the track from the rath. Isn&#x2019;t it late to be going home?&#x2019;</p><p>The girl dismissed the hour with laugh. &#x2018;Becc had many guests this evening. I had to stay to help my uncle in the kitchen. There was a great tidying to do. Isn&#x2019;t it always the same at the rath every night our chieftain entertains? I am often forced to stay until about this time. I thought you knew that.&#x2019;</p><p>He nodded absently. He did know it. He was counting on it. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll walk along the way with you.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Suit yourself,&#x2019; she replied. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s straight home for me. It&#x2019;s been an exhausting day.&#x2019;</p><p>She turned and recommenced her interrupted walk. She knew that his house lay in the general direction of her own and was not surprised at his offer to accompany her. He fell in step at her side.</p><p>He was smiling now. It was a fox-like smile but, in the gloom, she did not see the cunning mould of his features.</p><p>&#x2018;If you want to get home quickly, then the quicker path lies along the woodland shortcut over the shoulder of the hill. It takes fifteen minutes off the journey by this track where you have to go all round the base of the hill.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Across the Thicket of Pigs at this time of night?&#x2019; She laughed again. &#x2018;With wolves and who knows what wild animals along the way? And aren&#x2019;t you forgetting what has happened in those woods up on the hill?&#x2019;</p><p>He paused and spread his arms as if he would sweep the dangers aside.</p><p>&#x2018;I am here to protect you, aren&#x2019;t I?&#x2019; he demanded. &#x2018;Neither beast nor man would dare attack two grown adults. Come on. I am in a hurry to get home too and have further to go than you. That path is a full fifteen minutes in the saving of our journey. Surely that&#x2019;s a good prospect?&#x2019;</p><p>The girl hesitated, reluctantly seeing the logic of his argument.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s dark along the woodland path,&#x2019; she protested, but in a half-hearted fashion.</p><p>&#x2018;What? Dark? With the moon at its full, there&#x2019;s light enough for us to see the passing of a badger below the bushes at twenty paces. Come on! There is nothing to be fearful of since you are with me.&#x2019;</p><p>She hesitated only a fraction of a moment more and then slowly nodded agreement. &#x2018;Very well. But I mean to hurry along the path.&#x2019;</p><p>She went before him and for a second he raised his face to the great hanging white orb of the moon, eyes closed exultantly, letting the death-white flesh of his face bathe in the chilly white light.</p><p>&#x2018;Come on, then,&#x2019; he heard her call impatiently. &#x2018;What are you waiting for?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I am coming,&#x2019; he replied hastily. His heart was beating so loud that it seemed to drown out all other sounds. He felt the sweat trickling down his forehead and around his eye sockets. He raised a hand to wipe his face. Then he set off with slow sure steps after her shadowy form, as it seemed to momentarily vanish along the pathway into the moonlit woods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;My lord Becc, come quickly!&#x2019;</p><p>Becc, chieftain of the Cin�l na �eda, glanced up in annoyance as Adag, his steward, burst into his bedchamber without even the courtesy of knocking. It was an unforgivable lapse of social etiquette and he opened his mouth to deliver a reprimand, but the servant was continuing.</p><p>&#x2018;Brother Solam from the abbey has just arrived at the gates. The abbey is under attack,&#x2019; gasped the rotund and balding man. &#x2018;Abbot Brog�n asks that you go to his assistance immediately.&#x2019;</p><p>Becc had been up late, feasting and drinking with his guests. His head ached and his mouth was dry. He groaned a little and reached for a flagon that stood on a table near his bed. He raised it and took a mouthful or two directly from it. His face screwed into a look of distaste as the stale liquor washed down. His steward looked on with disapproval.</p><p>&#x2018;Wine is sweet in the drinking but bitter in the paying,&#x2019; observed Becc in self-defence, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.</p><p>Adag focused beyond the chieftain&#x2019;s shoulder and piously intoned: &#x2018;He who drinks only water will not be drunk.&#x2019;</p><p>Becc gazed at him sourly, opened his mouth and then closed it again. Another aphorism came unbidden into his mind. Let you be drunk or sober, keep your thoughts to yourself.</p><p>He rose and began to move rapidly, dressing quickly and ignoring his disapproving steward until he had buckled on his sword.</p><p>A dishevelled Brother of the Faith was waiting in agitation in the anteroom beyond. He was young, with fair hair.</p><p>&#x2018;Brother Solam,&#x2019; Becc greeted him. &#x2018;What is this news that you bring me?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The abbey is under attack, my lord Becc. My abbot bids you&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>Becc made a cutting motion with his hand, silencing the man.</p><p>&#x2018;The abbey is under attack? Who is attacking it?&#x2019; he demanded sharply.</p><p>&#x2018;The villagers, my lord. Yet another body, the body of the young girl named Ballgel, was found in the woods this morning...&#x2019;</p><p>The chieftain&#x2019;s eyes widened with shock. &#x2018;Ballgel? But she works in my kitchen. She was here last night until late because we had guests...&#x2019; He turned quickly to his steward, who had followed him. &#x2018;Adag, at what time did Ballgel leave the rath last night?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Just after midnight, lord. I was at the gate when she left. She went alone.&#x2019;</p><p>Becc turned to Brother Solam. &#x2018;It is certain that it was Ballgel who was killed?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It is certain. The villagers are in an ugly mood. This is the third young girl of the village who has been killed in as many months. A crowd has marched on the abbey and called upon the abbot to hand over the three visiting religious. The abbot refuses and now they are in fury, rage and clamour. They say they will attack the brethren and set fire to the abbey unless the strangers are handed over.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Why the strangers? Do the villagers have evidence that they killed Ballgel?&#x2019;</p><p>Brother Solam shook his head quickly. &#x2018;The villagers are full of fear and suspicion, lord. But that does not make them any the less dangerous.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I have already alerted the guard, my lord Becc,&#x2019; Adag intervened. &#x2018;The horses should be saddled by now.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Then let us ride for the abbey!&#x2019; Becc ordered decisively, turning to lead the way to the courtyard. &#x2018;Brother Solam can ride behind one of our warriors.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The abbey of the Blessed Finnbarr was only a short ride away, a cluster of wooden buildings gathered by the banks of the River Tuath. The buildings were encompassed by a wooden stockade which served to keep out wolves and other nocturnal scavengers. Before the wooden gates, which were hardly strong enough to exclude one determined man, a group of forty or fifty men and women had gathered. Facing them stood a slightly built, elderly religieux with silver hair. His clothing proclaimed him as a senior member of the community. At either side of him stood two young, nervous-looking brethren.</p><p>The old man was holding up his hands as if calling for quiet. However, the shouting and outrage of the crowd drowned out his words.</p><p>&#x2018;Hand over the strangers! We will deal with them!&#x2019;</p><p>At the forefront of the crowd was a thickset villager with a dark black beard and an angry expression. He carried a thick cudgel in one of his large hands. Those around him roared their approval of his belligerent leadership.</p><p>&#x2018;This is a house of God!&#x2019; The thin, reedy tone of the old man made itself heard in a momentary lull of the angry murmurs. &#x2018;No one dare enter the house of the Lord with violent intent. Go back to your homes.&#x2019;</p><p>At this the people howled their disapproval. Someone threw a small stone from the back of the crowd. It passed over the people&#x2019;s heads and struck harmlessly at the walls. But the implication was dangerous.</p><p>&#x2018;In the name of God, Brocc, take these people away from this place before harm is done.&#x2019; The old man appealed directly to the burly leader. They were almost face to face, so that no one else could probably hear the words of appeal.</p><p>&#x2018;Harm has already been done, Abbot Brog�n,&#x2019; replied the man as loudly as he could so that those around would know what was being said. &#x2018;More harm shall be done if you refuse to give up the strangers to justice.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Give them up to vengeance is what you mean. Our visitors walk in the shadow of God. They are protected not only under the ancient laws of hospitality but under the sacred rule of sanctuary.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You would protect the murderers of our children?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Where is your proof against them?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The proof is the mutilated bodies of our daughters!&#x2019; cried Brocc, raising his voice so that all the people could hear him.</p><p>A loud acclamation greeted his words.</p><p>&#x2018;You have no proof,&#x2019; countered one of the younger Brothers of the Faith at the abbot&#x2019;s side. Unlike the abbot&#x2019;s, his voice was young and strong and carried. &#x2018;You have come here only because these religious are strangers in our land and for no other reason. You fear them simply because they are strangers.&#x2019;</p><p>Another missile was aimed from the back of the crowd. This time it caught the young Brother a glancing blow on the forehead, causing a red gash of blood, and the impact made him stagger back a step or two. The crowd growled menacingly, like an animal, in their approval of the bloodshed.</p><p>&#x2018;Unless you wish to suffer the same fate as the strangers, Abbot Brog�n,&#x2019; threatened Brocc, &#x2018;you will hand them over.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You dare to threaten the abbot?&#x2019; cried the second Brother, his expression aghast. &#x2018;You have already raised your hands against the brethren of this community, for which God&#x2019;s punishment will surely pursue you. But you dare to threaten&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Enough of words!&#x2019; Brocc yelled and raised his cudgel menacingly.</p><p>It was then that the chieftain Becc, with Adag his steward and four of his warriors, came riding up, pushing their horses through the crowd. The people fell back with sullen expressi...</p></p><h2>Rebel Force #5: Trapped (Star Wars)</h2><p>All new stories featuring classic Star Wars characters<br><br>Old secrets make new trouble for our heroes as they try to track down their latest enemy.</p><p></p><h2>Focus On Middle School Biology Teacher&#39;s Manual</h2><p>The Focus On Middle School Biology Teacher&#x2019;s Manual accompanies the Focus On Middle School Biology Laboratory Workbook and the Focus On Middle School Biology Student Textbook.

She was then awarded an NSF postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of New Mexico, followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism. Instead, they allow students to make up their own minds about what the data show. Real Science-4-Kids, with its engaging, kid-friendly text and easy to use teacher-friendly manuals, is used in home, private, and public schools in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries.

How will the new technology change our lives? Do I have to learn to use a computer? Will my job become obsolete? Welcome to The Road Ahead. We have all been bombarded by the seemingly endless hype about the information highway and the coming age of technology. Now, Bill Gates - who built Microsoft into one of the most successful companies in the world - gives us his vision of what the future holds for us. The Road Ahead is his bird&#39;s-eye view of the undiscovered territory on the information highway - an authoritative, thought-provoking, and very readable travel guide for the journey. In this optimistic and refreshingly realistic book, Gates looks ahead to show how the emerging technologies of the digital age will transform all our lives. As he says, we are on the brink of a new revolution, and crossing a technology threshold that will forever change the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate with each other.</p><p>RICK ADAMSON's voiceover credits include industrials and commercials for radio, television, and audiobook recordings, including <i>The Secret</i> and <i>Younger Next Year</i>.For all who have marveled at the rapid advance of computers and their impact on our personal lives, Bill Gates stands out as a visionary. At an age when most students can barely see their own potential, Gates saw the revolutionary possibilities of the silicon chip. John Ottavino gives an enthusiastic presentation of Gates&#39;s historical review and predictions for the future of the information superhighway. The abridged text flows clearly and logically. Enhanced by Gates&#39;s own comments, this is an instructive and entertaining presentation. B.L.W.

But when a wealthy farmer asks for his help in smuggling a pair of rare black rhinos out of Zimbabwe (where they are murdered for their horns), he has a hard time saying no. Before he knows it, Lemmer is on a small airplane, zipping across the border, an airsickness bag in his hand and a military-grade shotgun at his feet. Soon, he will regret the trip very much.</p> <p>In <em>Trackers</em>, internationally-acclaimed thriller writer Deon Meyer expertly weaves together Lemmer&#x2019;s story with a missing person investigation and the machinations of a top intelligence agency. Wielding a phenomenal cast of characters, Meyer delves deep into the people, the breathtaking landscapes, and the politics and problems of this fascinating country. A #1 best-seller in South Africa, <em>Trackers</em> is an insightful novel that will take your breath away.</p></p><p>DEON MEYER lives near Cape Town in South Africa with his wife and four children.

Friday.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ismail Mohammed runs down the steep slope of Heiliger Lane. The coat-tails of his white jalabiya robe with its trendy open mandarin collar flick up high with every stride. His arms wave wildly, in mortal fear, and for balance. The crocheted kufi falls off his head onto the cobbles at the crossroad, as he fixes his eyes on the relative safety of the city below.<br>&nbsp;<br>Behind him the door of the one-storey building next to the Bo-Kaap&#x2019;s Schotschekloof mosque bursts open for the second time. Six men, also in traditional Islamic garb, rush out onto the street all looking immediately, instinctively downhill. One has a pistol in his hand. Hurriedly, he takes aim at the figure of Ismail Mohammed, already sixty metres away, and fires off two wild shots, before the last, older man knocks his arm up, bellowing: &#x2018;No! Go. Catch him.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>The three younger men set off after Ismail. The grizzled heads stand watching, eyes anxious at the lead they have to make up.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You should have let him shoot, Sheikh,&#x2019; says one.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;No, Shaheed. He was eavesdropping.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Exactly. And then he ran. That says enough.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;It doesn&#x2019;t tell us who he&#x2019;s working for.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Him? Ismail? You surely don&#x2019;t think . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;You never can tell.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;No. He&#x2019;s too . . . clumsy. For the locals maybe. NIA.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I hope you are right.&#x2019; The Sheikh watches the pursuers sprinting across the Chiappini Street crossing, weighing up the implications. A siren sounds up from below in Buitengracht.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Come,&#x2019; he says calmly. &#x2018;Everything has changed.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>He walks ahead, quickly, to the Volvo.<br>&nbsp;<br>From the belly of the city another siren begins to wail.<br>&nbsp;<br>She knew the significance of the footsteps, five o&#x2019; clock on a Friday afternoon, so hurried and purposeful. She felt the paralysis of prescience, the burden. With great effort she raised up her defences against it. Barend came in, a whirlwind of shampoo and too much deodorant. She didn&#x2019;t look at him, knowing he would be freshly turned out for the evening, his hair a new, dubious experiment. He sat down at the breakfast counter. &#x2018;So, how are you, Ma? What&#x2019;s cooking?&#x2019; So jovial.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Dinner,&#x2019; said Milla, resigned.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Oh. I&#x2019;m not eating here.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She knew that. Christo probably wouldn&#x2019;t either.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Ma, you&#x2019;re not going to use your car tonight, are you.&#x2019; In the tone of voice he had perfected, that astonishing blend of pre-emptive hurt and barely disguised blame.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Where do you want to go?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;To the city. Jacques is coming. He&#x2019;s got his licence.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Where in the city?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;We haven&#x2019;t decided yet.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Barend, I have to know.&#x2019; As gently as possible.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;<i>Ja</i>, Ma, I&#x2019;ll let you know later.&#x2019; The first hint of annoyance breaking through.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;What time will you be home?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Ma, I&#x2019;m eighteen. Pa was in the army when he was this old.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;The army had rules.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>He sighed, irritated. &#x2018;OK, OK. So . . . we&#x2019;ll leave at twelve.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s what you said last week. You only got in after two. You&#x2019;re in Matric, the final exams . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;<i>Jissis</i>, Ma, why do you always go on about it? You don&#x2019;t want me to have any fun.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I want you to have fun. But within certain limits.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>He gave a derisory laugh, the one that meant he was a fool to put up with this. She forced herself not to react.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I told you. We will leave at twelve.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Please don&#x2019;t drink.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Why do you worry about that?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She wanted to say, I worry about the half-bottle of brandy I found in your cupboard, clumsily hidden behind your underpants, along with the pack of Marlboro&#x2019;s. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s my job to worry. You&#x2019;re my child.&#x2019; Silence, as if he accepted that. Relief washed over her. That was all he wanted. They had got this far without a skirmish. Then she heard the tap-tap of his jerking leg against the counter, saw how he lifted the lid off the sugar bowl and rolled it between his fingers. She knew he wasn&#x2019;t finished. He wanted money too.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Ma, I can&#x2019;t let Jacques and them pay for me.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>He was so clever with his choice of words, with the sequence of favours asked, with his strategy and onslaught of accusation and blame. He spun his web with adult skill, she thought. He set his snares, and she stepped into them so easily in her eternal urge to avoid conflict. The humiliation could be heard in her voice. &#x2018;Is your pocket money finished?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Do you want me to be a parasite?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>The <i>you </i>and the aggression were the trigger, she saw the familiar battlefield ahead. Just give him the money, give him the purse and say take it. Everything. Just what he wanted.<br>&nbsp;<br>She took a deep breath. &#x2018;I want you to manage on your pocket money. Eight hundred rand a month is . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Do you know how much Jacques gets?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;It doesn&#x2019;t matter, Barend. If you want more you should . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Do you want me to lose all my friends? You don&#x2019;t want me to be fucking happy.&#x2019; The swearword shook her, along with the clatter of the sugar bowl lid that he threw against the cupboard.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Barend,&#x2019; she said, shocked. He had exploded before, thrown his hands in the air, stormed out. He had used <i>Jesus </i>and <i>God</i>, he had mumbled the unmentionable, cowardly and just out of hearing. But not this time. Now his whole torso leaned over the counter, now his face was filled with disgust for her. &#x2018;You make me sick,&#x2019; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>She cringed, experiencing the attack physically, so that she had to reach for support, stretch out her hand to the cupboard. She did not want to cry, but the tears came anyway, there in front of the stove with a wooden spoon in her hand and the odour of hot olive oil in her nose. She repeated her son&#x2019;s name, softly and soothingly.<br>&nbsp;<br>With venom, with disgust, with the intent to cause bodily harm, with his father&#x2019;s voice and inflection and abuse of power, Barend slumped back on the stool and said, &#x2018;Jesus, you are pathetic. No wonder your husband fucks around.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>The member of the oversight committee, glass in hand, beckoned to Janina Mentz. She stood still and waited for him to navigate a path to her. &#x2018;Madam Director,&#x2019; he greeted her. Then he leaned over conspiratorially, his mouth close to her ear: &#x2018;Did you hear?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>They were in the middle of a banqueting hall, surrounded by four hundred people. She shook her head, expecting the usual, the latest minor scandal of the week.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;The Minister is considering an amalgamation.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Which Minister?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;<i>Your </i>Minister.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;An amalgamation?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;A superstructure. You, the National Intelligence Agency, the Secret Service, everyone. A consolidation, a union. Complete integration.&#x2019; She looked at him, at his full-moon face, shiny with the glow of alcohol, looking for signs of humour. She found none.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Come on,&#x2019; she said. How sober was he?<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s the rumour. The word on the street.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;How many glasses have you had?&#x2019; Light-hearted.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Janina, I am deadly serious.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She knew he was informed, had always been reliable. She hid her concern out of habit. &#x2018;And does the rumour say when?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;The announcement will come. Three, four weeks. But that&#x2019;s not the big news.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Oh.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;The President wants Mo. As chief.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>She frowned at him.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Mo Shaik,&#x2019; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>She laughed, short and sceptical.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Word on the street,&#x2019; he said solemnly.<br>&nbsp;<br>She smiled, wanted to ask about his source, but her cellphone rang inside her small black handbag. &#x2018;Excuse me,&#x2019; she said, unclipping the handbag and taking out her phone. It was the Advocate, she saw.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Tau?&#x2019; she answered.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Ismail Mohammed is in from the cold.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Milla lay on her side in the dark, knees tucked up to her chest. Beyond weeping she made reluctant, painful discoveries. It seemed as though the grey glass, the tinted window between her and reality, was shattered, so that she saw her existence brilliantly exposed, and she could not look away.<br>&nbsp;<br>When she could no longer stand it, she took refuge in questions, in retracing. How had she come to this? How had she lost consciousness, sunk so deep? When? How had this lie, this fantasy life, overtaken her? Every answer brought greater fear of the inevitable, the absolute knowledge of what she must do. And for that she did not have the courage. Not even the words. She, who had always had words, in her head, in her diary, for everything.<br>&nbsp;<br>She lay like that until Christo came home, at half past twelve that night. He didn&#x2019;t try to be quiet. His unsteady footsteps were muffled on the carpet, he switched on the bathroom light, then came back and sat down heavily on the bed.<br>&nbsp;<br>She lay motionless, with her back to him, her eyes closed, listening to him pulling off his shoes, tossing them aside, getting up to go to the bathroom, urinating, farting.<br>&nbsp;<br>Shower, please. Wash your sins away.<br>&nbsp;<br>Running water in the basin. Then the light went off, he came to bed, climbed in. Grunted, tired, content.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just before he pulled the blankets over himself, she smelled him. The alcohol. Cigarette smoke, sweat. And the other, more primitive smell.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s when she found the courage.</p><h2>Rhinoceros, and Other Plays</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

Now, through a close examination of her own body--nose, lips, hair, skin, eyes, ass, bones and blood--which holds up a mirror to the way culture reads all bodies, she asks why we persist in thinking in terms of race today when racism is killing us. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her grandmother's family fled southern China for British Guiana after her great uncle was shot in his own dentist's chair during the First Sino-Japanese War. McWatt is made of this woman and more: those who arrived in British Guiana from India as indentured labour and those who were brought from Africa as cargo to work on the sugar plantations; colonists and those whom colonialism displaced. How do you tick a box on a census form or job application when your ancestry is Scottish, English, French, Portuguese, Indian, Amerindian, African and Chinese? How do you finally answer a question first posed to you in grade school: "What are you?" And where do you find a sense of belonging in a supposedly "post-racial" world where shadism, fear of blackness, identity politics and call-out culture vie with each other noisily, relentlessly and still lethally?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Shame on Me</i> is a personal and powerful exploration of history and identity, colour and desire from a writer who, having been plagued with confusion about her race all her life, has at last found kinship and solidarity in story.</p><p>TESSA McWATT, who won a 2018 Eccles British Library Award to research this book, is a professor of creative writing at University of East Anglia.

Big bets can determine a company&#39;s destiny or reshape its future. A century ago, James Mitchell engineer, builder, entrepreneur, and man of the world traveled to the impoverished American South and made the first big bet for Southern Company. Mitchell was so inspired by the hydro potential of Alabama s rivers that he dreamed of developing a series of dams to electrify the Southeast. To bring his dream to life, he sketched out a regional power network, raised money from British investors, and created the first of the three forerunner holding companies that would play prominent roles in Southern Company&#39;s history. In the century since, Southern Company and its predecessor companies have faced every conceivable impediment to progress natural and manmade disasters, a hostile takeover, federal invasions, financial ruin, and numerous threats and attempts to pull its business apart and scramble the pieces. Rather than being destroyed by these challenges, Southern Company grew strong, more resilient, and more committed to its mission. That Southern Company has not only survived for a century but also empowered the South to thrive is a reflection of the leaders who emerged to shepherd the company safely into tomorrow. Some had to deal with adversity at every turn. Some had to envision a different future to seize new opportunities. All had to make critical decisions when the moment mattered most. This is their story, the story of the dreams they pursued, the troubles they encountered, and the big bets they made.</p><p>Dub Taft &amp; Sam Heys have been associated with Southern Company through many of its transformations over the past four decades. Taft retired in 2011, following a 40-year career as a writer, editor, and communication manager. Heys continues as a writer and editor for Southern Company and is co-author of The Winecoff Fire: The Untold Story of America s Deadliest Hotel Fire.</p><h2>Tick Tock (A Michael Bennett Thriller, 4)</h2><p><strong>NYC's #1 detective, Michael Bennett, has a huge problem--the Son of Sam, the Werewolf of Wisteria and the Mad Bomber are all back.

Bruegel turned his critical eye and peerless paintbrush to mankind&#x2019;s labors and pleasures, its foibles and rituals of daily life, portraying landscapes, peasant life, and biblical scenes in startling detail. Much like the great humanist scholar Erasmus of Rotterdam, Bruegel questioned how well we really know ourselves and also how we know, or visually read, others. His work often represented mankind&#x2019;s ignorance and insignificance, emphasizing the futility of ambition and the absurdity of pride.<br><br> This superbly illustrated volume examines how Bruegel&#x2019;s art and ideas enabled people to ponder what it meant to be human. Published to coincide with the four-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of Bruegel&#x2019;s death, it will appeal to all those interested in art and philosophy, the Renaissance, and Flemish painting.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Honig</b> is professor of European art history at the University of California, Berkeley. She is the author of <i>Jan Brueghel and the Senses of Scale</i> and <i>Painting and the Market in Early Modern Antwerp</i>.&#x201c;In his own time, Pieter Bruegel&#x2019;s art has been praised as the ultimate achievement in the representation of nature. . . . Honig&#x2019;s book is the first to make us realize that this appraisal pertains to the representation of human nature of the people surrounding him&#x2014;workers in the field, citizens of Antwerp and Brussels, noblemen, children, mercenaries, lepers, religious dignitaries, art lovers, humanists, and the like&#x2014;and of humanity in general, inward and outward woman and man included. Bruegel&#x2019;s own personality and convictions, she writes, largely remain opaque, but it is thanks to Honig&#x2019;s marvelous descriptions of some of Bruegel&#x2019;s most renowned pictures that our eyes are opened to both the &#x2018;idea of nature&#x2019; as people conceived of it in his time, but also to Bruegel&#x2019;s personal, deeply perceptive ideas about human nature.&#x201d; (Reindert Falkenburg, NYU Abu Dhabi)<br><br>&#x201c;Eloquently and effectively, Honig fulfills the promise of her title with a fresh, close look at Bruegel, among contemporaries, within his tumultuous era. She clearly articulates how the artist examined themes concerning basic human nature across his career. But in the process, she reminds us that while this thoughtful, engaged man laughed at the vices and follies of all humankind, like Democritus, he also, self-consciously, ultimately left us mute images to interpret alone.&#x201d; (Larry Silver, University of Pennsylvania, author of "Rembrandt&#x2019;s Holland")</p><h2>Logan&#39;s Run</h2><p>It&#39;s the 23rd Century and at age 21... your life is over!

Fifty years ago Linda Palmer was attacked by celebrity entertainer Danny Caxton, yet no investigation ever took place. Now Caxton stands accused, at the centre of a historical abuse investigation, and it's Banks's first task as superintendent to find the truth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As more women step forward with accounts of Caxton's manipulation, Banks must piece together decades-old evidence. With his investigation uncovering things from the past that would rather stay hidden, he will be led down a path even darker than the one he set out to investigate . . .</p><p>PETER ROBINSON grew up in the United Kingdom, and now divides his time between Toronto and Richmond, Yorkshire. <i>When the Music's Over</i> is the 23rd book in the DCI Banks series. He has also written two collections of short stories, and three standalone novels, the most recent of which is the bestseller <i>Before the Poison</i>, winner of the Arthur Ellis Award in Canada, Sweden's Golden Crowbar Award, and the 2013 Dilys Award given by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Robinson's critically acclaimed crime novels have won numerous awards in Britain, the United States, Canada, and Europe, and are published in translation all over the world.

Murders and other violence follow; we are soon enmeshed in the nefarious doings of a neighborhood gang, Bronx politicos and the agency that runs the home. It&#39;s drama that doesn&#39;t translate in this audio version. Reader Sky Vogel&#39;s young voice sounds too perky to be a 40-something, frequently beat-up private investigator. He gives the gang members identically singsong falsettos. And on occasion, there is something vaguely Asian in the whispery Lydia Chin; more often, there is not. R.E.K.

In this modern adaptation, two parents, three children, and a cat travel in a minivan through a snowstorm, traffic jam, and a Thanksgiving Day parade to grandfather's house. After leaning out of the car window to get a closer look at a horse, the baby joins the parade by flying?through the air, in and out of a tuba, onto a giant balloon that collides with an airplane?and then parachuting with his baby blanket. Catrow gives these zany adventures life and humor with his caricatures featuring exaggerated expressions and different perspectives. The large format will attract young readers, but older children who know a more traditional rendition of this poem will enjoy the contrast with this version even more. The visual appeal of this book just might make it transcend the pumpkin-pie season. Consider shelving this rollicking romp with your picture books to give it more exposure.?Gale W.

Over the past thirty years his writing has changed the way the world thinks about design. He is the author of Death Drive, one the most talked about books of 2016.A British design critic (Harley Earl and the Dream Machine, 1983) offers an opinionated tour of the modern and mercurial concept of taste, that ``merciless betrayer of social and cultural attitudes.'' ``Good'' and ``bad'' taste, Bayley argues, are not absolutes, and no longer the simple matter of rules they were in Joshua Reynolds's England. Indeed, taste changes: El Greco was neglected until Picasso became his champion, and even Shakespeare was sometimes scorned. Thanks to Mme. de Pompadour (the ``ancien r&#x201a;gime version of `born to shop' ''), ``taste ceased to be metaphorical and became instead a particular vision of the haute-bourgeoisie.'' Much fun is to be had here contemplating the vulgarity of the leopard-skin upholstery in billionaire Alan Bond's Mercedes, or the way the nouveaux riches acquire ``an image of self'' by having Elsie de Wolfe buy them chandeliers or, today, Ralph Lauren dress them in the ``romanticized'' trappings of WASP society. The definitions here are neither simple nor pristine, and beg questions repeatedly asked. Taste, Bayley claims, has mostly to do with intentions (such as to impress). Yet good design is measurable- -``durable, affordable, useful, efficient.'' Unfortunately, good design has been confused with good taste--the meaning of ``good'' being debased by a specious sense of superiority. And ``designer'' became a ``dead'' label when it was attached to jeans. Clearly allied with the modernists for whom Walter Gropius's office is a shrine, Bayley sees their passion for simplicity and functionalism as born of a certain time and place. He has much to say about architecture (today mostly ``pure kitsch'') interior design (``the red light district of culture''), as well as fashion and food. Much of the impact of this smart, sweeping, intermittently clarifying commentary comes from well-captioned b&amp;w photographs of influential landmarks of taste--from a Paris restaurant of 1900 to Converse sneakers, Coco Chanel, a William Morris print, and the Rothschilds' chateau. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

How to Conquer Your Self-Destructive Patterns</h2><p>As children, our brains are hard-wired to form attachments with others as a way to ensure our physical and emotional survival. How we attach to our primary caregivers directly affects how our brain develops and guides our feelings and thoughts in later relationships. <p><i>Why Can't I Change?</i> is a psychological self-help manual to improve self-esteem and overall well-being. It is for anyone who feels stuck repeating patterns in their lives that don't work - from a series of dead end jobs, bad relationships, or even self-sabotaging behaviors. <i>Why Can't I Change?</i> incorporates the latest research on brain science to see how your identity is not defined by your behavior but is a reaction to your early programming. Dr. Shirley Impellizzeri identifies four categories of attachment styles we adopt as children based on our perceptions of how those most influential in our lives perceived us. </p><p>Throughout the book, Dr. Impellizzeri uses a particular case history from infancy to adulthood to illustrate how an attachment style plays out in life. The stories and other concrete examples bring this concept to life and make it easy to identify with. This book shows you how to put an end to dysfunctional patterns of behavior by helping you discover what your unconscious patterns are and how to let go of those patterns. <i>Why Can't I Change?</i> includes questionnaires, exercises, and tools to facilitate change.</p></p><p>Stuck in the same dead-end job?

How to Conquer Your Self-Destructive Patterns, leading psychologist Shirley Impellizzeri, PhD, explains how you get stuck in ruts, gives you scientific proof that you can change, and then shows you how.

A versatile genius who could have pursued a number of brilliant careers with equal virtuosity, he was a mathematical prodigy, an accomplished astronomer, a skillful anatomist, and a founder of the Royal Society. Eventually, he made a career in what he described disparagingly in later life as "Rubbish" -- the architecture, design, and construction of public buildings. </p><p>Through the prism of Wren's tumultuous life and brilliant intellect, historian Lisa Jardine unfolds the vibrant, extraordinary emerging new world of late-seventeenth-century science and ideas. </p></p><p><p>Lisa Jardine, Commander of the Order of the British Empire, is the director of the Centre for Editing Lives and Letters, the centenary professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary, University of London, and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. She lives with her husband and three children in London.</p>This is the second biography of Wren (1632-1723) to appear in the last year, following Adrian Tinniswood's His Invention So Fertile (Oxford). Renaissance scholar Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution, etc.) takes the cultural historical tack that has brought her scholarly renown, providing not only a nearly day-by-day account of the polymathic British architect's most important moments but minutely detailed background on institutions like the Royal Society and the Royal Observatory (along with the Order of the Garter), on developing science (blood transfusion, longitude) and on people: the royal families, Robert Hooke, John Evelyn. Wren was appointed to the Rebuilding Commission established after the devastating Great Fire of London in 1666, becoming in time responsible for the design and rebuilding of all 51 churches destroyed by the fire, and for the reconstruction of St. Paul's. By the time Wren came to that work by which he is best known, he had already achieved enormous distinction as a scientist, inventor and mathematician-and he was 34 years old. By 1689, he was at work renovating Hampton Court Palace for William and Mary, the third royal family he had served; in their reign, he was appointed surveyor of Westminster Abbey in 1698, a post he held until his death. To stick with Jardine requires a serious interest in Wren and period history. The rich documentation-the full text of private and public papers (e.g., letters of patent, royal warrants, correspondence, receipts, marginalia, excerpts from diaries) and 80 b&amp;w illustrations and a 16-page color insert-may dizzy the reader who is not intimate with 17th century prose style, but will astonish those who are. And Jardine's discovery of an underground chamber in the Monument to the Great Fire is something any amateur sleuth will enjoy. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Prayer: Life&#39;s Limitless Reach</h2><p>1 NEW HARDCOVER BOOK WITH DUST COVER</p><p>Jack R.

"I know my mom won't mind," he reassures his guests. Equally well-mannered, they prepare birthday presents for him, which are actual items tucked into cunningly designed pockets on each spread. The cows, for example, bestow The Singing Cows Song Book by "Babette Calf and Ron Van der Moo," which contains such loopy lyrics as "Woke up this morning, / Blue down to our hooooves, / There ain't no cream in our cattlecake, / And we've got the / Moo moo Bloooos." The sharks proffer a tin of Loch Mess salmon, marked "best before opening." Then the celebrants congregate for the infectiously zany festivities, and the rest is icing on the birthday cake. As usual, Cole's ( The Silly Book ; The Trouble with Grandad ) winsome pictures offer the wacky and unexpected at every turn.

His rule brought 20 years of peace to sixth-century Britain, then a politically primitive, long-favored butt of marauding conquerors from the Romans to the Saxons. Inevitably, though, most questions relating to Arthur remain unanswered: such basic information as the location of his court is still not known, for example (sites in central Scotland, southwestern and northern England have been proposed, to no conclusion). His royal "entourage" Andronik narrows to a select but definite few including Guenevere, his wife; Lancelot, a stellar knight who was also Arthur's best friend; and the scurrilous Mordred, either Arthur's nephew or his illegitimate son, who killed him (and was killed) in battle. Though the legends and their factual loopholes are inherently fascinating, Andronik's tendency to plod in the writing may dull a reader's appetite. Not a storyteller by inclination, she collects alternate plots and characters with fastidious care yet ignores the suspense innate in historical detective work. Illustrations not seen by PW.

Enforcing discipline with age-old tools of violence and intimidation, the Calabrians have been responsible for nearly 40 murders in Australia since the mid-1970s, and many more before that. Mafia families in Australia report directly to bosses in Calabria and profits are funneled back to the mother organization. Yet despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Federal and State law enforcement agencies have long assured the public that there is no Calabrian mafia in Australia. With powerful and uncompromising clarity, <i>Evil Life </i>shatters this myth.

Forty years after her death, O'Connor's fiction still retains its original power and pertinence. For those who know nothing of O'Connor and her work, this new study by Ralph C. Wood offers one of the finest introductions available. For those looking to deepen their appreciation of this literary icon, it breaks important new ground.<br>Unique to Wood's approach is his concern to show how O'Connor's stories, novels, and essays impinge on America's cultural and ecclesial condition. He uses O'Connor's work as a window onto its own regional and religious ethos. Indeed, he argues here that O'Connor's fiction has lasting, even universal, significance precisely because it is rooted in the confessional witness of her Roman Catholicism and in the Christ-haunted character of the American South.<br>These are some of the engaging moral and religious questions that Wood explores: the role of religious fundamentalism in American culture and in relation to both Protestant liberalism and Roman Catholicism; the practice of racial slavery and its continuing legacy in the literature and religion of the South; the debate over Southern identity, especially whether it is a culture rooted in ancient or modern values; the place of preaching and the sacraments in secular society and dying Christendom; and the lure of nihilism in contemporary American culture.</p><p>Ralph C. Wood is University Professor of Theology and Literature at Baylor University, Waco, Texas.Wood, one of our most astute critics of Christianity and literature, offers a splendid study of O'Connor, one of our most enigmatic Southern writers. Raised in Savannah and Milledgeville, Ga., O'Connor found herself a Catholic in a deeply Protestant South. But as Wood demonstrates, she was at home there, as she used her stories and novels to challenge what she saw as the sentimental piety of her own faith and the dullness of the Protestant liberalism of her time. Drawing on O'Connor's fiction, letters, book reviews and occasional writings, Wood examines key topics from race and the burden of Southern history to preaching and vocation. Although the depth of O'Connor's religious devotion reflected the sacramentalism of her Catholic faith, Wood ingeniously points out the debt she owed to the Bible-centered vision of Protestant theologian Karl Barth and to the images of fallenness that Reinhold Niebuhr offered in his famous work <i>The Nature and Destiny of Man</i>. Rather than reading thematically through O'Connor's entire oeuvre, Wood selects stories and episodes from novels that illustrate his thesis about O'Connor's concerns. Wood observes that most of O'Connor's stories end with a graceful scene in which her protagonists experience a revelatory moment, "at once disclosing the horror of sin but also overcoming the horror with hope." Although there is no end to the books on O'Connor, Wood's elegant exploration of her theological reading of Southern culture provides fresh insight into her relevance for us today. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Everything had been consumed by cloud. The storm&#x2019;s immensity caught the attention of scientists on the International Space Station. Even from there, it seemed almost limitless: 1.8 million square feet of tightly coiled bands so huge they filled the windows of the Station. It was the largest storm anyone had ever seen.<br><br>Initially a tropical storm, Sandy had grown into a hybrid monster. It charged across open ocean, picking up strength with every step, baffling meteorologists and scientists, officials and emergency managers, even the traditional maritime wisdom of sailors and seamen: What exactly was this thing? By the time anyone decided, it was too late.<br><br>And then the storm made landfall.<br><br>Sandy was not just enormous, it was also unprecedented. As a result, the entire nation was left flat-footed. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration couldn&#x2019;t issue reliable warnings; the Coast Guard didn&#x2019;t know what to do. In <i>Superstorm</i>, journalist Kathryn Miles takes readers inside the maelstrom, detailing the stories of dedicated professionals at the National Hurricane Center and National Weather Service. The characters include a forecaster who risked his job to sound the alarm in New Jersey, the crew of the ill-fated tall ship <i>Bounty</i>, Mayor Bloomberg, Governor Christie, and countless coastal residents whose homes&#x2014;and lives&#x2014;were torn apart and then left to wonder . . .

Her writing has also appeared in Best American Essays. She lives in Belfast, Maine.<p></p><p></p><p>LANDFALL</p><p>THE SKY WAS lit by a full moon that night, but no one could see it. Everything&#x2014;the enormous harvest moon, the stars, the horizon&#x2014;had been consumed by cloud. The storm was so immense it caught the attention of scientists on the International Space Station, who stopped what they were doing and peered out their windows. From there, the cloud cover seemed almost limitless: 1.8 million square feet of tightly coiled bands so huge they filled the windows of the station, so thick they showed only the briefest insinuation of an eye. It was the largest storm the planet had ever seen&#x2014;a storm big enough to consume the entire Eastern Seaboard and beyond.</p><p>It had already wreaked devastation in the Caribbean, taking lives and destroying families. Now the storm was marching up the Atlantic, turning the ocean into unimaginable chaos. Waves the size of a two-story house collided against one another, exploding in foam and fury and blocking everything else from view as millions of pounds of water rose and crashed and fell, only to rise again. Those same waves fueled the machine that created them, sending more and more moisture into the storm&#x2019;s core, where energy exploded with the force of a nuclear bomb. Gale-force winds rose and then spread out for 870 nautical miles, threatening everything in their path. The system was growing.</p><p>Nightfall came by imperceptible degrees. The wind and rain did not. They were soon punctuated by an omnipresent moaning: a kind of dark, low hum that made it seem as if the entire world was haunted. Within minutes, that moan became a constant, pervasive shriek as gusts of 90 miles per hour were recorded everywhere from Washington, D.C., to New York City. Barometers plummeted to unseen lows, heralding the force of the storm. So, too, did the apocalyptic precipitation that began to follow: almost thirteen inches of rain in Bellevue, Maryland; nearly six in Cleveland, Ohio. Twenty inches of snow fell in places like Kentucky and Newfound Gap, a low pass in the Great Smoky Mountains that divides North Carolina and Tennessee. In West Virginia, more than three feet of snow fell near the town of Richwood, collapsing roofs and collecting into barricade-like drifts six feet tall.</p><p>At the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., keepers scrambled to corral their charges inside, wrangling elephants and clouded leopards, the facility&#x2019;s iconic pandas, and even a spindly, two-week-old dama gazelle. As they did, the storm turned inland, fixing a bead on the mid-Atlantic coast. Heralded by hurricane-force winds, the storm announced its arrival long before it made landfall, knocking down power lines and exploding transformers. A woman in Toronto was killed when a large illuminated sign pulled from its supports, then plummeted thirty feet to the ground. An eight-year-old Pennsylvania boy died when a tree fell in his Franklin Township yard. Not long after, an enormous oak fell through a home in North Salem, New York, crushing two best friends, ages eleven and thirteen, but leaving the rest of the home&#x2019;s occupants unharmed.</p><p>And still the storm continued its relentless beat to shore, charging across three hundred miles of open ocean, picking up strength with every step. Meteorologists and scientists, officials and emergency managers stood baffled: What <i>was</i> this thing? By the time many of them decided, it was too late to issue warnings, too late to persuade millions of people their lives were in danger.</p><p>Gusts rose to 83 knots, building the waves higher, blowing off their tops and sending cataracts of salt water through the air for miles. Across Manhattan, those residents who resisted the call to evacuate struggled to walk down rain-swept streets, where litter tornadoed around telephone poles and newspaper kiosks. Awnings sheared off of storefronts and took flight. Flags stood straight and solid; trees rippled as if suddenly liquefied. Nearly a thousand miles away, spray from twenty-foot surf on Lake Michigan crashed onto Chicago museum-goers and commuters. At the international airport in Gary, Indiana, 50-mile-per-hour winds grounded planes. Hundreds of stranded passengers sat packed in terminals from Baltimore to Oklahoma City&#x2014;and beyond.</p><p>By 6:00 P.M. that evening, three million people were without power, most of them in Manhattan and the surrounding boroughs. The lights went out on Broadway. Wall Street ground to a standstill and would remain closed for two days&#x2014;the first time weather had shut down stock markets for consecutive days since the Great Blizzard of 1888. Out on Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty&#x2014;whose newly renovated crown had reopened to visitors just one day before&#x2014;lost her torchlight and went dark.</p><p>At New York University&#x2019;s Langone Medical Center, hospital officials were certain their patients would be safe, despite the deteriorating conditions outside. But the facility&#x2019;s backup power system soon failed, shrouding the eighteen-story complex in blackness and requiring the evacuation of three hundred patients into a caravan of ambulances that extended blocks down rain-torn streets. The first to emerge from the darkened hospital were twenty infants from the neonatal intensive care unit, each one cocooned in blankets and heating pads and carried down nine flights of stairs by nurses, administrators, and maintenance workers. They worked by flashlight and feel, delivering first the babies and then the most critical patients, some of whom weighed well over two hundred pounds. They moved silently, synchronized, and often arm in arm, working together in teams of five or ten and stopping frequently to check breathing tubes and vitals. The only audible sound, some would report later, was that of the growing wind and surf. Waves so big they hardly seemed real rolled through streets. It was like being in a movie, said the staff, only much, much scarier.</p><p>That same surge swamped beaches and shoreline from Florida to Nova Scotia. It sank boats in Bar Harbor, Maine, and swept as far inland as Albany, New York&#x2014;nearly 150 miles from the coast.</p><p>And then the storm itself arrived.</p><p>It hit land like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what? Like a freight train or an atomic explosion or an alien invasion? People tried to find a comparison, but everything fell short. It was a hurricane that wasn&#x2019;t a hurricane. A superstorm. And as it hit like whatever it was, the storm sheared away sections of Atlantic City&#x2019;s iconic boardwalk before inundating the streets with a wall of wave eight feet high. Within minutes, more than 75 percent of the city was underwater. Sixty miles away, in Seaside Heights, the storm ripped the Jet Star Roller Coaster&#x2014;a massive structure with seventeen hundred feet of steel track and fifty-foot drops&#x2014;from its pier and relocated it in the ocean shallows. It swept entire houses from their foundations and pulled cars into the surf. In Fall River, Massachusetts, the storm peeled away roofs and flooded Battleship Cove. In New London, Connecticut, it pulled the town&#x2019;s iconic bathhouse from its pilings and left in its place a household stove, along with cords of splintered timber. The weather station atop New Hampshire&#x2019;s Mount Washington registered gusts of 139 miles per hour.</p><p>Back in Manhattan, seawater poured down stairs and vents into subway stations, filling tunnels from track to ceiling. At the NYU medical center, the most critical patients had been safely evacuated, but thousands of animals used for medical testing had not. More than ten thousand mice and rats, many of which had been genetically altered for cancer and mental illness research, drowned in their basement cages. Seven thousand trees fell in New York City parks. More than sixty-five thousand boats were destroyed in New York alone. The city, one meteorologist said, was living its own worst-case scenario.</p><p>The force of the wind and sea exploded electrical transformers and caused massive fires that destroyed both fin de si�cle mansions in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, and more than one hundred working-class homes in Queens. Other damage created a kind of cruel <i>carniv�le</i>: As the storm marched across the region, it neatly piled sailboats at the end of a dry pier and left floating taxicabs in their slips. It relocated a fishing vessel onto railroad tracks and pushed pickup trucks into backyard pools. Dining rooms filled with sand. Floodwaters plucked the New York Aquarium&#x2019;s resident three-foot American eel from its tank and deposited it, unharmed, in a staff shower stall.</p><p>But those were the easy stories. Most were far more grim.</p><p>More than ten feet of salt water flooded the low-lying areas of Staten Island. There, neighbors banded together and decided to make a last-minute run for it. They set out down their street, but were soon stopped by a wave of dark water bearing down on them. They turned and raced the opposite way, only to stop dead in their tracks. An angry wall of water was coming from that direction, too. It snaked, leapt, spun, and crashed, picking up bits and pieces of people&#x2019;s lives: toilets and kitchen sinks, pianos and sewing machines, lawn mowers and bicycles, porches and chimneys. Jack-o&#x2019;-lanterns bobbed their way through the storm-churned water by the hundreds, a parade of ghoulish faces amid the chaos.</p><p>There was no escape.</p><p>The waves continued to grow, cannoning through windows and doors and deluging homes. Within minutes, that water was lapping at attic floors.</p><p>In the Oakwood neighborhood, two men sought shelter on the second story of a home after their car stalled on the street below. Within minutes, floodwater was above their chests. They jimmied open the attic window and looked into the surge of water, now at eye level. A car floated by, then a Dumpster. And then&#x2014;what was that? The roof of an entire house. Still attached to the house. The whole damn thing was floating on the angry tide. They agreed to take a chance. On three, they leapt out the window and onto the floating roof. There, they dug their nails into the shingles, trying not to get dizzy as the building spun its way through the crashing water.</p><p>Not everyone was so lucky.</p><p>The same rising sea caught several elderly people unawares and trapped them in their homes. The residents screamed for help, but neighbors couldn&#x2019;t reach them: The waters were just too high, too fast. The bodies of the trapped would be found floating in living rooms and bedrooms days later. So, too, would the body of an off-duty police officer who relocated his family, including his fifteen-month-old son, to their attic before retreating back downstairs to secure the rest of the house. The family waited for hours, but he never returned. Another father and son were found in their basement, their bodies locked in a tight embrace, the dead father&#x2019;s arms still shielding his son&#x2019;s head.</p><p>In Tottenville, Staten Island, a family of three who had been robbed during Hurricane Irene also chose to remain in their home, despite the evacuation orders. As they finished dinner, the waters began flooding their house, lifting the dining room from its foundation and eventually shearing it away. They ran to their second-story master bedroom, but within minutes the water began pouring in through the windows and doors there as well. They retreated to the bathroom, where the mother and her thirteen-year-old daughter clung to the sink faucet as storm water lapped at their chins. And then the entire wall of their house gave way, pouring them out into the churning surge. Waves tore them from each other. The mother called&#x2014;no, shrieked&#x2014;her daughter&#x2019;s name, but the plea evaporated in the roar of water. She kept calling, clinging to the sink, flinching each time another house slid into the waves. Hours later, she was deposited on a pile of debris. She was severely hypothermic but otherwise unharmed. It would be days before the bodies of the father and daughter were found.</p><p>As news of the rising water began to intensify, another mother bundled her two boys, ages two and four, and tucked them into their car seats, then set out for a family member&#x2019;s house in Brooklyn. She thought she was doing the right thing&#x2014;keeping her boys safe. But their SUV was soon overtaken by swell. The car stalled. Water began to pour in. She struggled with her seat belt, slipped into the back and wrestled both boys out of their car seats, took a deep breath, and crashed into the surge. The waves were unrelenting. They crashed upon her, pulling the mother and boys down. She clung more tightly. The waves kept coming. And then the biggest one of all struck. It tore the boys from her arms before sweeping her away, too. She clung, first to a tree, and then to the hope that someone would help. But no one would answer their door&#x2014;no one would take that risk, no matter how much she begged and cried. Exhausted, she collapsed on a stranger&#x2019;s porch and waited until daybreak, then walked the flooded streets until she found a police officer. Days later, the bodies of the boys were found less than twenty feet from each other, tangled in reeds and debris in a marsh at the end of a dead-end street.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>ON AVERAGE, ABOUT six hurricanes develop each year. Fewer than two of them strike the United States. Major storms&#x2014;storms with winds greater than 110 miles per hour&#x2014;occur even less frequently: one every eighteen months, give or take. The chance that one of those storms will strike New York City is 3.2 percent. None of these statistics mattered at all with Superstorm Sandy. There was no precedent, no authoritative model or soothing data to help make sense of what was happening. The world had simply never witnessed a storm like this one.</p><p>Barometric pressures that day, October 29, 2012, were the lowest ever recorded north of the Carolinas. Surge levels were their highest. And the damage wrought by this storm was immense. Sandy damaged or destroyed a million homes. More than half of those were in the United States, located in a damage area roughly the size of all of Europe. Nearly nine million households were without power from South Carolina to Maine. Rain from the storm reached as far west as the Dakotas and as far south as Texas. Thousands of acres of shoreline were severely eroded. By the time Sandy dissipated somewhere over western Pennsylvania, at least 147 people had lost their lives in places as far-ranging as Jamaica and Canada.</p><p>This storm&#x2014;this superstorm&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t supposed to be that deadly. And it certainly wasn&#x2019;t supposed to make landfall in the most populated region of North America. Nor was it supposed to morph into a monstrous hybrid the likes of which our oceans had never born. And that&#x2019;s what was so terrifying about this storm. Hurricane Sandy broke all the rules.</p><p>Its story began just more than a week before it made landfall.</p><p></p><p></p><p>SUNDAY</p><p></p><p>3:00 A.M.</p><p>National Weather Service Forecast Office</p><p>Mt.

They didn&#39;t go out on the streets to satisfy idle curiosity, or to experience a strange new world. They didn&#39;t go out to find answers to questions, solutions to problems. They didn&#39;t go out to save anyone, or to hand out donations of food and blankets. They went out with one primary aim: to be as present as possible to everyone they met-to love their neighbor as themselves. Doing so, they were reminded just how difficult the practice of compassion can be, especially because of personal judgments, assumptions, fears and desires, all habits of mind that harden one&#39;s regard for and behavior toward other people. The Emptiness of Our Hands: A Lent Lived on the Streets is a meditative narrative accompanied by nearly thirty black and white photographs, most of them shot by James using crude pinhole cameras that he constructed from trash.

Either you acknowledge the existence of manmade climate change and consider it a dire global threat, or you deny it exists at all. But there's a third group: the &#x201c;lukewarmers.&#x201d; In <em>Lukewarming: The New Climate Science that Changes Everything</em>, Cato scholars Pat Michaels and Chip Knappenberger explain the real science and spin behind the headlines and come to a provocative conclusion: global warming is not hot&#x2015;it's lukewarm. While that may not sound massive, it does, as the book's subtitle notes, change everything. Climate change is real, it is partially man-made, but it is clearer than ever that its impact has been exaggerated&#x2015;with many of the headline-grabbing predictions now being rendered implausible or impossible. <br><br> This new paperback edition of the book is a revised and expanded edition of last year's ebook-only edition of <em>Lukewarming. </em>This new edition includes updates in science and policy following the accords reached at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. It is an equally perfect book for those looking for an introduction to the climate debate, or veterans seeking the freshest science. <br><br><br></p><p>Patrick J. Michaels is the director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute. Michaels is a past president of the American Association of State Climatologists and was program chair for the Committee on Applied Climatology of the American Meteorological Society. He is the author or editor of six books on climate and its impact, and he was an author of the climate &#x201c;paper of the year&#x201d; awarded by the Association of American Geographers in 2004. <br><br>Chip Knappenberger is the assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, and coordinates the scientific and outreach activities for the Center. He has over 20 years of experience in climate research and public outreach. He has published numerous papers in the major atmospheric science journals on global warming, hurricanes, precipitation changes, weather and mortality, and Greenland ice melt, among many other areas, and is a very popular presenter at climate conferences worldwide. <br>Pat Michaels and Paul Knappenberger are real climate scientists, who think that man-made global warming is real. But they refuse to buy into the politicized pseudoscience that has increasingly been used to buttress the case that global warming is also likely to be dangerous. For this they have been routinely vilified. In this light but serious book, they expose many shocking myths about climate change and make a devastating case for lukewarming. -- Matt Ridley, Author of The Rational Optimist</p><h2>The Practice of Management</h2><p><p> A classic since its publication in 1954, <i>The Practice of Management</i> was the first book to look at management as a whole and being a manager as a separate responsibility. <i>The Practice of Management</i> created the discipline of modern management practices.

Then he stepped through the resulting aperture, leaving behind a heavily ribbed cavern of polished duranium that had once been the cargo bay of an Yridian freighter. </p><p> Had this been any other Yridian vessel, Picard would have been entering an airlock, the black, frigid vacuum of space visible through transparent slivers in the surface at its far end. Instead, he found himself in a short, unremarkable corridor, its only illumination the parallel tracks of tiny floor lights guiding his footsteps. </p><p> Several wildly echoing strides brought Picard to another octagonal portal. As before, he waited for the thing to blossom like a flat, metal flower. Then he emerged into the chiseled, black environs of a Tellati armory. </p><p> Of course, there weren't any weapons in this armory -- not anymore. But Picard had seen enough Tellati hulks to recognize the rows of elaborately wrought clamps set at intervals in the bulkhead, designed to hold enough disruptor rifles for the needs of an entire Tellati crew. </p><p> Picard doubted that the armory's original owners would have approved of the bright, jazzy music currently wafting through it, or the airy, blue lighting, or the rich, buttery fragrance that teased the captain's nostrils. </p><p> But then, the armory was now serving as a bar of sorts -- just as the cargo bay Picard had just left behind had been recast as the lobby of a rather seedy-looking spa. </p><p> In fact, if he kept walking through enclosure after enclosure and navigated correctly, he would find himself traversing bits and pieces of a great many vessels -- not just Yridian and Tellati, but Klingon and Ubarrak and Orion, and on and on -- a seemingly endless conglomeration of them. </p><p> Together they formed a strange and unique city -- a city in orbit around a world that had never spawned life of its own. A city called Oblivion. </p><p> Or rather, that was the nickname it had been given by the earliest Terrans to frequent the place. In the original Ubarrak, it was called Obl'viaan. </p><p> Picard didn't know how or why the first two ships in the by now immense complex had been cobbled together, or who was responsible for the cobbling. As far as he could tell, no one else knew either. </p><p> But little by little, other ships had been added -- derelicts and sections of derelicts, space stations and half-destroyed hulks of space stations, some old and some relatively new, some easily recognizable and some not. And gradually, the city called Oblivion had taken on a purpose. </p><p> It had become a place where merchants of all species and backgrounds could cluster -- where they could peddle their wares and work out their deals without the specter of interstellar politics looming over them. </p><p> It didn't matter who was at war with whom, or who had offended whose leaders. In Oblivion, traders from both sides of the conflict could still carry out their transactions in peace. Nor did it matter whether they were selling medicines, high-yield plasma explosives, or the latest in exotic entertainments. </p><p> Nothing was forbidden. No peaceful commercial activity was off-limits. </p><p> But for all its license, Oblivion wasn't a lawless place. Quite the opposite. It had its government and its rules, and a contingent of security officers who were only too happy to enforce them. </p><p> Like the orbital city's merchants and traders, its security force was made up of many different species. And while those represented in the greatest numbers were Rythrian, Enolian, and Tyrheddan, there were also a few Vobilites, Dedderac, Lurassa, and even humans. </p><p> As Picard took in the confines of the armory, with its several humanoid denizens sitting along an obsidian bar or scattered among tables, he remarked yet again to himself how fertile Oblivion would be for scholarly inquiry. </p><p> It was especially true from an archaeological perspective -- Picard's favorite since his days at the Academy. Where else could one find the aft section of a hundred-year-old Meskmaali squadron fighter? Or a Rigelian ore transport of a perhaps even earlier vintage? </p><p> Picard would have loved to have the time to explore the place, scratching his archaeological itch at each stop along the way. But since his arrival in Oblivion a couple of days earlier, he had been forced to devote himself to this one particular portion of the city -- and his study of it had been anything but archaeological. </p><p> After all, he had a mission to carry out here. </p><p> And an unusual mission it was. Quite a change of pace from his normal duties, which called for him to direct the activities of an entire starship and her crew. </p><p> In Oblivion, Picard was only responsible for directing his own activities -- and keeping his identity a secret in the process. He wasn't even wearing his cranberry-and-black Starfleet uniform, having exchanged it for a colorless set of civilian garments before leaving the <i>Stargazer</i>. </p><p> It was rare for a Starfleet captain to skulk around undercover, much less to do so entirely on his own. However, on this occasion he had no other option. When an opportunity of this magnitude came up, one had to seize the day. </p><p> If all went according to plan, Picard would be doing just that in a little more than an hour. But he didn't want to appear at his prearranged rendezvous point too soon, lest he attract undue attention. </p><p> He could have returned to his hotel, but it was a little too far away. Or he could simply have wandered about the place. But he preferred to remain there at the bar, which was only a short walk from his destination, and minimize the possibility of something going wrong. </p><p> Besides, no one would question the notion of someone sitting in a bar for half an hour. Even a short walk in the warm, dry environments of Oblivion was likely to make a fellow thirsty, and Picard was no exception. </p><p> Aiming to address the problem, he crossed the room and took one of the few empty seats in front of the bartender -- a human-looking female, though appearances were often deceiving in a place like Oblivion. There were a number of species that looked human at a glance, but were something else entirely. </p><p> At the moment, the bartender was attending to a Tellarite -- a corpulent, white-haired specimen -- who was in the midst of what seemed to be a long-winded tale, if the eye-rolling of his fellow patrons was any indication. </p><p> "And then," the Tellarite said in that blustery tone characteristic of his species, "I told him to take his phase coils and get out of my sight. I'd been trading too long to lay out good credits for shoddy merchandise. 'Shoddy?' he bellowed. 'You wouldn't know a quality phase coil if it was inserted into your left nostril!' Naturally, I wasn't going to stand for that sort of abuse..." </p><p> Picard could see why the other patrons were rolling their eyes. Unless one was a dealer in phase coils, the Tellarite's saga was anything but riveting. </p><p> Nonetheless, the bartender didn't take her eyes off the Tellarite for even a second. She appeared to hang on his every word, no matter how uninteresting it might have been to anyone else in earshot. </p><p> And she wasn't just listening because she had to, it seemed to Picard. She was listening because she wanted to, because she actually <i>enjoyed</i> it. </p><p> Of course, it might just have been an act on her part, a tactic designed to help business. But if it was, it was a bloody convincing one. </p><p> The captain didn't even mind having to wait to place his order. He was content for the moment to watch the woman smile a serene and knowing smile at the Tellarite, and fill his mug with something viscous and ocher-colored. </p><p> The Tellarite seemed to appreciate it too, if his delighted snorts were an accurate measure. And his species wasn't known for getting along well with humans. </p><p> Picard admired anyone who turned in a good job, whether it was commanding a starship or maintaining a food replicator. And in his opinion, the bartender wasn't just doing a <i>good</i> job -- she was doing a <i>great</i> one. </p><p> It would have been nice to have such a person doling out libations on the <i>Stargazer</i>. There was plenty of stress involved in running a starship; there were plenty of raw nerve endings at the end of the day. A bartender in the right setting would go a long way toward helping everyone unwind. </p><p> Unfortunately, it wasn't even remotely practical for the captain to try to shoehorn a bar into the <i>Stargazer</i>'s cramped, little lounge. And even if he could get one in there somehow, he doubted he could bend regulations enough to staff it with non-Starfleet personnel. </p><p> As he pondered the idea, the bartender began to move in his direction, appearing to glide the length of the slick, black surface. "What can I get you?" she asked, smiling at him as warmly as if they were old friends. </p><p> <i>Very</i> old friends. </p><p> In fact, Picard had to wonder for a moment if they had actually met somewhere before. But he ruled out the possibility in short order. He had been blessed with an impeccable memory when it came to faces, and the bartender's wasn't at all familiar to him. </p><p> Nonetheless, he found himself smiling back at her. "Tea," he said. "Earl Grey, if you've got it. Hot." </p><p> "Oh," she said, "I've <i>got</i> it all right." </p><p> Turning to the replicator mechanism on the wall behind her, she punched a code into its data pad. A soft yellow glow became visible through the device's transparent door. When it subsided, she opened the door and removed a steaming black cup. </p><p> Even before she placed it in front of the captain, he could smell the familiar, soothing aroma. Earl Grey, he thought with a rush of contentment. </p><p> "There you go," said the bartender. "You know, I don't get many requests for tea, Earl Grey or otherwise." </p><p> The captain grunted. "Really." </p><p> She tilted her head as if to get a better look at him. "Obviously, you're from Earth." </p><p> "I am," he said, "yes." </p><p> "But," she added appraisingly, "you don't miss it much. You'd much rather be out here, in the far reaches of space, where every moment brings the possibility of adventure." </p><p> It was true. Picard could have followed in the footsteps of his father, a distinguished vintner, but instead he had chosen to make a career for himself among the stars. </p><p> But was his thirst for exploration that obvious? So much so that a person he had barely met could sense it? </p><p> "Are you sure about that?" he asked. </p><p> The woman nodded confidently. "Pretty sure. When you meet as many people as I do, you develop a knack for knowing what makes them tick." </p><p> The captain wanted to speak with her further -- on that or any other topic, well into the night if he'd had the time. Her manner was that pleasant, that inviting. </p><p> But he <i>didn'</i>t have the time. He was on a mission. And pretty soon, it would call him away. </p><p> "Impressive," he told the bartender. </p><p> But he didn't continue to engage her. In fact, he made a point of looking around the place, as if he had some genuine interest in the furnishings. By the time he turned around again, the woman had moved down the bar to one of her other customers. </p><p> Obviously, she had taken his hint. Picard breathed a small sigh of relief -- or was it disappointment? -- until he realized that the patron next to him was staring at him. </p><p> Like the bartender, she appeared to be human -- in her mid-to-late twenties, if Picard was any judge of such things. Her long, charcoal gray dress and elaborate hat of the same somber hue concealed what appeared to be an unremarkable build. </p><p> Still, the captain might have called her attractive if not for the unexpected look in her dark brown eyes. It was a desolate look. A look that spoke of loss and missed opportunities, of pain and humiliation. </p><p> Of surrender. </p><p> It struck Picard that she was the exact opposite of the woman who had served him his tea. This person seemed dead inside, hollowed out by some terrible ordeal, while the bartender couldn't have been more alive. </p><p> "Do I know you?" he finally asked the woman. </p><p> She stared at Picard a moment longer, as if caught in some strange kind of inertia. Then, in a voice as weary and defeated as her eyes, she said, "You've got hair." </p><p> It was a bizarre observation, to say the least. "Apparently so," he responded. </p><p> The woman's eyes narrowed. "You don't remember...?" Her voice fell like a wounded bird. </p><p> The captain looked at her. "Remember <i>what?"</i> </p><p> Her brow puckered. "No," she said with something like resignation. "Of course you don't." </p><p> Picard didn't want to leave it at that -- not after she had fired up his curiosity. But his mission prevented him from pressing her for the information. </p><p> After all, if she <i>did</i> know him, she could expose him for who he was -- and that would pretty much throw a hyperspanner in the works, wouldn't it? His best bet was to remain silent, and hope it was simply a case of mistaken identity. </p><p> The woman stared at him a moment longer, looking as if she was inclined to say something more to him. Then, with a deep and uncomfortably prolonged sigh, she shook her head and turned back to her drink. </p><p> And he turned back to his. </p><p> But as Picard sat there sipping his tea, he continued to watch his neighbor out of the corner of his eye -- and every so often she would sneak a peek at him. Apparently, she still couldn't decide if he was who she thought he was. </p><p> Less than eager to give her a chance to do so, he finished his Earl Grey as quickly as he could. Then, plunking down the appropriate coinage as payment and gratuity, he left the bar and the woman in the hat behind him. </p><p> The captain hadn't intended to be on his way so quickly. He had hoped to nurse his tea for a while, to linger over it. Now he would have to proceed at an all-too-leisurely pace, perhaps even loiter here and there, lest he reach the location of his rendezvous too soon. </p><p> He frowned. In every plan, there was an x factor -- an unexpected element. The woman in the unusual hat had been such an element. </p><p> He could only hope he wasn't going to have to deal with any others. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by Paramount Pictures.

She shares her home in South Carolina with her four dogs and a resident ghost named Mary Margaret.Seven women wronged by the justice system join together to seek vengeance. It might seem that so many women sharing the secrets of their newly formed vigilante sisterhood would be a recipe for disaster, but their bond of friendship grows deeper as the plot thickens. Laural Merlington's interpretation of Michaels's characters will assist each listener in identifying with at least one of the women, and, although each character's story and identity are distinctly different from those of any other, Merlington weaves the parts in such a way that listeners will find the plot easy to follow. One hopes this introduction to the sisterhood is the first of a future series--with Merlington as narrator.

He presents the results of his 10-year-long interdisciplinary research in an easily understandable, even entertaining manner. Inspite - or even because - of the disgraceful hostility, provoked by his theories, this book keeps being of ardent topicality, which in the light of recent scientific research is even growing. Earth in Upheaval - a very exactly investigated and easily understandable book - contains material that completely revolutionizes our view of the history of the earth. For all those who have ever wondered about the evolution of the earth, the formation of mountains and oceans, the origin of coal or fossils, the question of the ice ages and the history of animal and plant species, Earth in Upheaval is a MUST-READ!</p><p>When a book is republished after half a century at first you certainly think of antiquarian, maybe literary, or perhaps historical interest. With the books of Immanuel Velikovsky it is a different case. Their topicality and explosiveness has rather increased since their first publication - in disciplines diverse as geology, anthropology, archaeology, paleontology, astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, classical studies, Egyptology, theology, psychology and also in theory of science. Because in all these disciplines the first publication of his books provoked controversies unprecedented in the history of science since Galileo. At the same time recent findings mainly in earth and planetary sciences have confirmed his results and conclusions in a really impressive manner.<br> <p>There are only a few books which - like the present one - preserve their topicality even after half a century without any changes in its text. We consider it all the more important to let the works of Immanuel Velikovsky speak for themselves and to republish them without any omissions or additions. In this way the original work with its revolutionizing contents and its unique style will be made available to the interested readers - scientists and laymen alike - and so hopefully the unbiased interdisciplinary scientific discussion about Velikovsky's theories will be supported after being long overdue.<br> </p><p>Science should increase our knowledge. In the first place this includes the open and serious discussion of facts and theories, their study, research and - if necessary - the adjustment of the methods and paradigms to the facts, not vice versa. In this respect the study of Velikovsky's works, and above all the history of their acceptance in academic circles, can teach us a lot about our understanding of science and from a psychological point of view about our understanding of ourselves.<br> </p><p>Summing up, we are convinced that the republication of the complete works of Immanuel Velikovsky can give fundamental impulses for numerous, very diverse fields of knowledge, for science in general as well as for the view of the world of our society - and at the same time lead to a proper appreciation of the life's work of a man who, searching for knowledge and enlightenment, was personally as well as professionally confronted with the most devastating reactions.</p>Earth in Upheaval is a book about the great tribulations to which the planet on which we travel was subjected in prehistorical and historical times. The pages of this book are transcripts of the testimony of mute witnesses, the rocks, in the court of celestial traffic. They testify by their own appearance and by the encased contents of dead bodies, fossilized skeletons. Myriads upon myriads of living creatures came to life on this ball of rock suspended in nothing and returned to dust. Many died a natural death, many were killed in wars between races and species, and many were entombed alive during great paroxysms of nature in which land and sea contested in destruction. Whole tribes of fish that had filled the oceans suddenly ceased to exist; of entire species and even genera of land animals not a single survivor was left.<br> <p>The earth and the water without which we cannot exist suddenly turned into enemies and engulfed the animal kingdom, the human race included, and there was no shelter and no refuge. In such cataclysms the land and the sea repeatedly changed places, laying dry the kingdom of the ocean and submerging the kingdoms of the land.<br> </p><p>In Worlds in Collision I presented the chronicles of two - the very last - series of such catastrophes, those that visited our earth in the second and first millennia before the present era. Since these upheavals occurred in historical times, when the art of writing had already been perfected in the centers of ancient civilization, I described them mainly from historical documents, relying on celestial charts, calendars, and sundials and water clocks discovered by archaeologists, and drawing also upon classical literature, the sacred literature of East and West, the epics of the northern races, and the oral traditions of primitive peoples from Lapland to the South Seas. Geological vestiges of the events narrated in documents and traditions were indicated only here and there, when I felt that the immediate testimony of the rocks must be presented along with the historical evidence. I closed that description of cataclysmic events with a promise to attempt, at a later date, the reconstruction of similar global catastrophes of earlier times, one of them being the Deluge.<br> </p><p>I had intended, after piecing together the history of these earlier global upheavals, to present geological and paleontological material to support the testimony of man. But the reception of Worlds in Collision by certain scientific groups persuaded me, before reviving the pageant of earlier catastrophes, to present at least some of the evidence of the rocks, which is as insistent as that carried down to our times by written records and by word of mouth. This testimony is never given in metaphors; and as with the pages of the Old Testament or of the Iliad, nothing can be changed in it. Pebbles and rocks and mountains and the bottom of the sea will bear witness. Do they know of the days, recent and ancient, when the harmony of this world was interrupted by the forces of nature? Have they entombed innumerable creatures and encased them in rock? Have they seen the ocean moving on continents and continents sliding under water? Was this earth and the expanse of its seas showered with stones and covered by ashes? Were its forests, uprooted by hurricanes and set afire, covered by tides carrying sand and debris from the bottom of the oceans? It takes millions of years for a log to be turned into coal but only a single hour when burning. Here lies the core of the problem: Did the earth change in a slow process, a year added to a year and a million years to a million, the peaceful ground of nature being the broad arena of the contest of throngs, in which the fittest survived? Or did it happen, too, that the very arena itself, infuriated, rose against the contestants and made an end of their battles?<br> </p><p>I present here some pages from the book of nature. I have excluded from them all references to ancient literature, traditions, and folklore; and this I have done with intent, so that careless critics cannot decry the entire work as "tales and legends." Stones and bones are the only witnesses. Mute as they are, they will testify clearly and unequivocally. Yet dull ears and dimmed eyes will deny this evidence, and the dimmer the vision, the louder and more insistent will be the voices of protestation. This book was not written for those who swear by the verba magistri - the holiness of their school wisdom; and they may debate it without reading it, as well.</p></p><h2>It&#39;s Potty Time-Girls (It&#39;s Time to)</h2><p>Toilet training is a natural step in a child&#39;s development.

Steve McQueen tells the story of a small-town kid from modest means who went on to become one of the biggest icons in Hollywood. Much more than just a simple account of his career highlights, this volume delves deep into what made McQueen one of the most interesting and enigmatic figures of 20th century popular culture. Featuring new research revealing previously unknown and surprising information about his early history; behind-the-scenes stories from some of his greatest films - including The Great Escape, Bullitt, and Papillon; the truth about his larger-than-life exploits; as well as his lesser-known humanitarian work, this volume captures the essence of what made Steve McQueen the ultimate &#39;King of Cool&#39;.</p><p>Marshall Terrill is a best-selling author and highly regarded McQueen expert.Approaching the thirtieth anniversary of Steve McQueen&#x2019;s death, Terrill builds on his previous work, Steve McQueen: Portrait of an American Rebel (1994), to delve further into the star&#x2019;s life. McQueen, known for his ultracool and antiheroic movie persona, started out life in rural Indiana. Born to a young, alcoholic woman and abandoned by his father, he was left in the care of his grandparents. Reunited with his mother at age eight, he was introduced to a series of her abusive and violent boyfriends. Compounding his problems were his partial deafness from a childhood ear infection and his dyslexia, making his adjustment to his new life particularly challenging. The young McQueen frequently got into trouble and soon found himself remanded to a home for troubled teenage boys. Following that, he joined the U.S. Marines and used the G.I. bill to study acting in New York. There, his rebellious angst and good looks helped him become a fixture of the theater scene, with movie and television success soon following. Terrill provides behind-the-scenes stories spanning McQueen&#x2019;s career, his tumultuous love life, his greatest films, and, eventually, his fight with cancer. Well-written and exhaustively detailed. --Kathleen Hughes</p><h2>Terrorism and the Illuminati: A Three-Thousand-Year History</h2><p>A three thousand year history of the occult, and its relationship with the phenomenon of terrorism, for the purposes of fomenting a Clash of Civilizations and a "New World Order.".<br> Islam is no threat to the West. On the contrary, Islamic terrorism is a phantom created to serve Western imperialistic goals. Terrorism itself is expressly forbidden in Islam.<br> Such terror groups as exist are artificial, and intertwined with Western power through a network of occult secret societies, that date back to the Babylonian Kabbalah of the 6th century BC, and a plot to rule the world by magic and deception.<br> Under Herod the Great, a series of dynasties arose, who imposed a corrupt version of Christianity upon the Roman world. During the Crusades, their association with the Ismaili Assassins formed the basis of what is known as Scottish Rite Freemasonry.<br> When Napoleon conquered Egypt, these Freemasons reconnected with their brethren there, sparking developments like the Occult Revival of the late 19th century, the Salafi reform movement of Islam, promoted by Saudi Arabia, and Nazism. They founded the Muslim Brotherhood, a collective of impostors run by the CIA, to further the scheme for world domination.<br> Appearances belie reality. In fact, the Muslim nations are the victims of terror from the West. With their near-complete control of the media, the powers that be have instilled an inverted image of the real world.</p><p>Islam does not pose a threat to the West. Rather, Islamic terrorist organizations have been created to serve Western imperialistic objectives. These groups are intertwined with Western power through a network of occult secret societies. This is a relationship that dates back to the birth of the Kabbalah, in Babylon, in the sixth century BC, and a plot to seek world domination through the use of magic and deception. <p> The conspiracy coalesced under Herod the Great, who gave rise to a series of dynastic relationships that would cooperate, first, to impose a corrupt version of Christianity upon the Roman Empire, Catholicism, with which they would struggle ever since for supremacy over Western civilization. During the Crusades, these families associated with their counterparts in the East, members of the heretical Ismaili Muslims of Egypt, known as the Assassins. The basis of this relationship became what is known as Scottish Rite Freemasonry.</p><p> With Napoleon's conquest of Egypt, these Freemasons reconnected with their brethren in Egypt, sparking a relationship that was pivotal to the development of the Occult Revival of the late nineteenth century. It produced the Salafi reform movement of Islam, since promoted by Saudi Arabia, and the Nazis of Europe. Together, they collaborated to found the Muslim Brotherhood, a collective of Islamic impostors, operated by the CIA, to foment a Clash of Civilizations, towards implementing a New World Order.</p>David Livingstone converted to Islam in 1991, and has since committed himself to further understanding the true meaning of the religion. After thirteen years of research, he completed his first book, The Dying God: The Hidden History of Western Civilization, which studies the evolution of the occult from ancient times to the French Revolution. Knowing that terrorism was contrary to the principles of Islam, the author began to investigate the dubious relationships between Islamic fundamentalism and Western imperialism. This study led him to the current book, completing the timeline of the first, by exploring its subject into modern times, but also expanding upon it, by shedding light on new and more profound discoveries.</p><h2>Everything I Know about Women I Learned from My Tractor</h2><p>Best-selling author and humorist Roger Welsch comes through again as he delivers his outrageous anecdotes from the farm fields of Nebraska.

Saira Shah is the English-born daughter of an Afghan aristocrat, inspired by his dazzling stories to rediscover the now lost life their forebears presided over for nine hundred years within sight of the minarets and lush gardens of Kabul and the snow-topped mountains of the Hindu Kush. Part sophisticated, sensitive Western liberal, part fearless, passionate Afghan, falling in love with her ancestral myth&#x2013;chasing Afghanistan&#x2013;Shah becomes, at twenty-one, a correspondent at the front of the war between the Soviets and the Afghan resistance. Then, imprisoning herself in a <i>burqa</i>, she risks her life to film <i>Beneath the Veil</i>, her acclaimed record of the devastation of women&#x2019;s lives by the Taliban. Discovering her extended family, discovering a world of intense family ritual, of community, of male primacy, of arranged marriages, and finding at last the now war-ravaged family seat, she discovers as well what she wants and what she rejects of her extraordinary heritage.</p><p>Saira Shah lives in London and is a freelance journalist. She was born in Britain of an Afghan family, the daughter of Idries Shah, a writer of Sufi fables. She first visited Afghanistan at age twenty-one and worked there for three years as a freelance journalist, covering the guerilla war against the Soviet occupiers. Later, working for Britain&#x2019;s Channel 4 News, she covered some of the world&#x2019;s most troubled spots, including Algeria, Kosovo, and Kinshasa, as well as Baghdad and other parts of the Middle East. Her documentary <i>Beneath the Veil</i> was broadcast on CNN.<b>Book One<br>The Garden</b><br><i><br>Wherever there is a spring of fresh water, men and bees and ants will gather.<br>-Jalaluddin Rumi</i><br><br>1<br><br>Iam three years old. I am sitting on my father's knee. He is telling me of a magical place: the fairytale landscape you enter in dreams. Fountains fling diamond droplets into mosaic pools. Coloured birds sing in the fruit-laden orchards. The pomegranates burst and their insides are rubies. Fruit is so abundant that even the goats are fed on melons. The water has magical properties: you can fill to bursting with fragrant pilau, then step to the brook and drink-and you will be ready to eat another meal.<br><br>On three sides of the plateau majestic mountains tower, capped with snow. The fourth side overlooks a sunny valley where, gleaming far below, sprawls a city of villas and minarets. And here is the best part of the story: it is true.<br><br>The garden is in Paghman, where my family had its seat for nine hundred years. The jewel-like city it overlooks is the Afghan capital, Kabul. The people of Paghman call the capital Kabul jan: beloved Kabul. We call it that too, for this is where we belong.<br><br>"Whatever outside appearances may be, no matter who tells you otherwise, this garden, this country, these are your origin. This is where you are truly from. Keep it in your heart, Saira jan. Never forget."<br><br>Any western adult might have told me that this was an exile's tale of a lost Eden: the place you dream about, to which you can never return. But even then, I wasn't going to accept that. Even then, I had absorbed enough of the East to feel I belonged there. And too much of the West not to try to nail down dreams.<br><br>My father understood the value of stories: he was a writer. My parents had picked Kent as an idyllic place to bring up their children, but we were never allowed to forget our Afghan background.<br><br>Periodically during my childhood, my father would come upon the kitchen like a storm. Western systematic method quickly melted before the inspiration of the East. Spice jars tumbled down from their neat beechwood rack and disgorged heaps of coloured powder on to the melamine sideboard. Every pan was pressed into service and extra ones were borrowed from friends and neighbours. The staid old Aga wheezed exotic vapours-saffran, zeera, gashneesh; their scents to this day are as familiar to me as my own breath.<br><br>In the midst of this mayhem presided my father, the alchemist. Like so many expatriates, when it came to maintaining the traditions, customs and food of his own country he was plus royaliste que le roi. Rather than converting lead into gold, my father's alchemical art transported our English country kitchen to the furthest reaches of the Hindu Kush.<br><br>We children were the sorcerer's apprentices: we chopped onions and split cardamom pods, nibbling the fragrant black seeds as we worked. We crushed garlic and we peeled tomatoes. He showed us how to steep saffron, to strain yoghurt and to cook the rice until it was dana-dar, possessing grains-that is, to the point where it crumbles into three or four perfect round seeds if you rub it between your fingers.<br><br>In the kitchen, my father's essential Afghaniyat, Afghan-ness, was most apparent. The Afghan love of pilau is as fundamental to the national character as the Italian fondness for spaghetti. The Amir Habibullah, a former ruler of Afghanistan, would demolish a vast meal of pilau, meatballs and sauce for lunch, then turn to his courtiers and ask: "Now, noblemen and friends, what shall we cook tonight?"<br><br>We knew to produce at least three times more pilau than anyone could ever be expected to eat. Less would have been an insult to our name and contrary to the Afghan character. As my great-great-great-grandfather famously roared: "How dare you ask me for a small favour?"<br><br>If, at any point, my father found himself with an unexpected disaster-rice that went soggy or an overboiling pan that turned the Aga's hotplate into a sticky mess-he would exclaim: "Back in Afghanistan, we had cooks to do this work!"<br><br>He would tell us, with Afghan hyperbole: "We are making a Shahi pilau, a pilau fit for kings. This recipe has been handed down through our family since it was prepared for up to four thousand guests at the court of your ancestors. It is far better than the pilau you will find when you visit homes in Afghanistan today."<br><br>On one notable occasion, my father discovered the artificial food colouring, tartrazine. A pilau-making session was instantly convened. Like a conjurer pulling off a particularly effective trick, he showed us how just one tiny teaspoon could transform a gigantic cauldron of pilau to a virulent shade of yellow. We were suitably impressed. From that moment on, traditional saffron was discarded for this intoxicating substance.<br><br>Years later, I learned that all of the Afghan dishes my father had taught me diverged subtly from their originals. His method of finishing off the parboiled rice in the oven, for example, was an innovation of his own. Straining yoghurt through cheesecloth turned out to be merely the first stage in an elaborate process. In Kent, rancid sheep's fat was hard to come by, so he substituted butter. Cumin was an Indian contamination. And so it went on.<br><br>Yet although his methods and even his ingredients were different, my father's finished dishes tasted indistinguishable from the originals. He had conveyed their essential quality; the minutiae had been swept away.<br><br>During these cookery sessions, we played a wonderful game. We planned the family trip to Afghanistan that always seemed to be just round the corner. How we would go back to Paghman, stroll in the gardens, visit our old family home and greet the relatives we had never met. When we arrived in the Paghman mountains, the men would fire their guns in the air-we shouldn't worry, that was the Afghan way of welcome and celebration. They would carry us on their shoulders, whooping and cheering, and in the evening we would eat a pilau that eclipsed even the great feasts of the court of our ancestors.<br><br>My mother's family background, which is Parsee from India, rarely got a look in. As far as my father was concerned, his offspring were pure Afghan. For years, the mere mention of the Return was enough to stoke us children into fits of excitement. It was so much more alluring than our mundane Kentish lives, which revolved round the family's decrepit Land Rover and our pet Labrador, Honey.<br><br>"Can we take the Land Rover?" asked my brother Tahir.<br><br>"We shall take a fleet of Land Rovers," said my father grandly.<br><br>My sister Safia piped up: "Can we take Honey?"<br><br>There was an uncomfortable pause. Even my father's flight of fantasy balked at introducing to Afghans as a beloved member of our family that unclean animal, the dog.<br><br>When I was fifteen, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Afghanistan. During a pilau-making session quite soon after that, I voiced an anxiety that had been growing for some time now. How could my father expect us to be truly Afghan when we had grown up outside an Afghan community? When we went back home, wouldn't we children be strangers, foreigners in our own land? I expected, and possibly hoped for, the soothing account of our triumphant and imminent return to Paghman. It didn't come. My father looked tired and sad. His answer startled me: "I've given you stories to replace a community. They are your community."<br><br>"But surely stories can't replace experience."<br><br>He picked up a packet of dehydrated onion. "Stories are like these onions-like dried experience. They aren't the original experience but they are more than nothing at all. You think about a story, you turn it over in your mind, and it becomes something else." He added hot water to the onion. "It's not fresh onion-fresh experience-but it is something that can help you to recognize experience when you come across it. Experiences follow patterns, which repeat themselves again and again. In our tradition, stories can help you recognize the shape of an experience, to make sense of and to deal with it. So, you see, what you may take for mere snippets of myth and legend encapsulate what you need to know to guide you on your way anywhere among Afghans."<br><br>"Well, as soon as I'm eighteen I'm going to go to see for myself," I said, adding craftily: "Then perhaps I'll have fresh experiences that will help me grow up."<br><br>My father had been swept along on the tide of his analogy. Now, he suddenly became a parent whose daughter was at an impressionable age and whose country was embroiled in a murderous war.<br><br>"If you would only grow up a little in the first place," he snapped, "then you would realize that you don't need to go at all."<br><br>April 2001<br><br>At thirty-six years old, Ihave never seen Afghanistan at peace. I am choking under the burqa, the pale blue veil, which begins in a cap upon my head. It covers my face, my body, my arms and my legs, and is long enough to trip me up in my muddy plastic shoes. A crocheted grille obscures my vision. A grid of black shadows intersects trees, fields and the white road outside. It is like looking out through prison bars.<br><br>I have not had enough air for four hours now and we have eight more to go before we reach Kabul. I have an almost irresistible urge to do whatever it takes to breathe, simply breathe. How can I describe it? I want to rip off the burqa in the way that a drowning man will grapple his rescuer in his urge to reach the air above. But I cannot: it is all that protects me from the Taliban. Even lifting the front flap of my burqa is a crime, punishable by a beating.<br><br>In the front of the car, the taxi driver fumbles in a secret compartment and produces a cassette. It is a good sign: music is banned. I was told that we would have a safe car with a driver we knew, but when it came down to it, we jumped into a taxi at random.

Known for her defiance and outspokenness, Wolf was not especially surprised to discover forty-two volumes of documents produced by the East German secret police. But what was surprising was a thin green folder whose contents told an unfamiliar&#x2015;and disturbing&#x2015;story: in the early 1960s, Wolf herself had been an informant for the Communist government. And yet, thirty years on, she had absolutely no recollection of it.<br> Wolf's extraordinary autobiographical final novel is an account of what it was like to reckon with such a shocking discovery. Based on the year she spent in Los Angeles after these explosive revelations, <i>City of Angels</i> is at once a powerful examination of memory and a surprisingly funny and touching exploration of L.A., a city strikingly different from any Wolf had ever visited.<br> Even as she reflects on the burdens of twentieth-century history, Wolf describes the pleasures of driving a Geo Metro down Wilshire Boulevard and watching episodes of <i>Star Trek </i>late at night. Rich with philosophical insights, personal revelations, and vivid descriptions of a diverse city and its citizens, <i>City of Angels</i> is a profoundly humane and disarmingly honest novel&#x2015;and a powerful conclusion to a remarkable career in letters.</p></p><p><p><b>Christa Wolf</b> (1921-2011) was one of the most celebrated German writers of the postwar era. A central figure in East German literature and politics, she was arguably the foremost German-German writer, awarded major literature prizes in East, West, and reunified Germany. Her wide-ranging work&#x2015;nonfiction, fiction, and hybrids of the two&#x2015;is marked throughout by rigorous self-examination, political engagement, and committed feminism. Her most important reexaminations of the cultural past and personal memory include <i>Cassandra</i>, a crucial text for Western feminists and a secret social critique for her readers in the East; <i>Patterns of Childhood</i>, a groundbreaking reflection on growing up in Nazi Germany; and <i>City of Angels</i>, a sequel of sorts to <i>Patterns of Childhood</i> that takes place after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>TO COME DOWN TO EARTH<br>&nbsp;<br><br>was the phrase that came to me when I landed in L.A. and the passengers on the airplane clapped to thank the pilot for flying it across the ocean, approaching the New World from the sea, circling for a long time above the lights of the giant metropolis, then gently touching down. I still remember how I decided to use that sentence later, when I would write about the landing and the sojourn on a foreign coast that lay ahead. Later: Now. That so many years would pass in dogged attempts to reach the sentences which were to follow, to reach them in the right way, was something I could not foresee. I decided to fix everything in my memory for later, every detail. How my blue passport caused a stir with the wiry red-blond <i>officer</i> who was rigorously and carefully checking the papers of every arriving visitor; he flipped through its pages for a long time, studied every single visa, then picked up the invitation letter from the CENTER, under whose auspices I would be spending the following months, a letter certified and authenticated many times over; finally he looked straight at me with his ice-blue eyes: <i>Germany?&nbsp;&#x2014;Yes. East Germany.&nbsp;</i>&#x2014;I would have found it hard to give him any further details, because of the language barrier too, but he decided to ask a colleague for advice over the phone. The whole scene seemed familiar&#x2014;how well I knew the feeling of tense excitement and the sense of relief too when he finally, having no doubt received a satisfactory answer to his question, stamped the visa and slid my passport back across the counter with a hand covered in freckles. <i>Are you sure that country exists?&nbsp;&#x2014;Yes, I am</i>, I said curtly, even though the correct answer would have been <i>No</i> and I had to wonder, during my long wait for the luggage, whether it was really worth it to travel to the United States with the still-valid passport of a no-longer-extant country just to confuse a young redheaded immigration official. That was one of the acts of defiance I was still capable of then, acts which, it occurs to me now, become fewer and fewer with age. And there the word stands on the page, mentioned in passing, as is only fitting: the word whose shadow flickered across me for the first time then, more than a decade and a half ago, and has meantime grown so thick and dark that I have to worry about its becoming impenetrable before I can fulfill the duties of my profession. Before I have described, that is, how I hauled my bags down off the baggage carousel, loaded them onto an oversize luggage cart, and headed for the EXIT in the middle of a confusing crowd of people. How, having barely set foot in the terminal, something happened that according to all the earnest pleas and warnings from experienced travelers I should never have let happen: a giant black man came up to me, <i>Want a car, ma&#x2019;am?</i>, and I, inexperienced creature of reflexes that I was, nodded yes, instead of resolutely refusing the way I had been told to. Already the man had snatched the cart and set off with it&#x2014;I would never see it again, or so my alarm system told me. I followed after him as quickly as I could and there he was, in fact, standing outside on the curb of the access road where taxis were rolling up, bumper to bumper, their headlights dimmed. He pocketed the dollar he was entitled to and handed me over to a colleague, also black, who had gotten himself a job waving down taxis. He too discharged his duties, stopped the next taxi, helped me load my bags into the trunk, likewise received his dollar, and turned me over to the skinny little driver, an agile Puerto Rican whose English I couldn&#x2019;t understand but who obligingly listened to mine and, after studying the letterhead with my future address on it, seemed to know where he was supposed to take me. Only then, when the taxi started driving, I remember, did I feel the mild night air, the breath of the south, which I recognized from an entirely different coast where it had come over me for the first time like a thick warm towel&#x2014;at the airport in Varna. The Black Sea, its velvety darkness, the sweet heavy scent of its gardens.<br>I can still, today, feel myself in that taxi, with chains of lights racing by on either side and sometimes streaming into handwriting&#x2014;world-famous brand names, billboards in garish colors for supermarkets, for bars and restaurants, outshining the night sky. Words like &#x201c;orderly&#x201d; would be out of place here, on this coastal road, perhaps on this whole continent. Very softly, and quickly repressed again, the question came to mind: What had actually made me come here?&#x2014;just loud enough for me to recognize it the next time it announced itself, already more urgent than before. In any case, the scaly trunks of the palm trees glided by as though they were reason enough. The smell of gas and exhaust. A long drive.<br><i>Santa Monica, ma&#x2019;am?&nbsp;&#x2014;Yes.&nbsp;&#x2014;Second Street, ma&#x2019;am?&nbsp;&#x2014;Right.&nbsp;&#x2014;Ms. Victoria?&nbsp;&#x2014;Yes.&nbsp;&#x2014;Here we are.</i><br>For the first time, the illuminated metal sign affixed to the iron fence: MS. VICTORIA HOTEL, OLD WORLD CHARM. Everything quiet. All the windows dark. It was a little before midnight. The driver helped me with my luggage. A front lawn, a path of stone slabs, the smell of unknown flowers that apparently gave off a scent at night, the weak light of a gently swaying lamp over the front door, a doorbell which had, stuck behind it, a piece of paper with my name on it. <i>Welcome</i>, I read. The door was open, I should go right in, the key to my apartment was on the table in the hall, <i>second floor, room number seventeen, the manager of the </i><i>MS. VICTORIA</i><i> wishes you a wonderful night</i>.<br>Was I dreaming? But unlike in a dream I didn&#x2019;t lose my way, I found the key, took the right stairs, the key fit in the right lock, the light switch was where it was supposed to be, in the blink of an eye I can see it all before me: Two floor lamps lighting a large room with a cluster of armchairs opposite a long dining table surrounded with chairs. I paid the taxi driver, to his apparent satisfaction, with the unfamiliar money that I had luckily exchanged in Berlin before my departure, thanked him in an appropriate way, and received, as was proper, the answer: <i>You&#x2019;re welcome, ma&#x2019;am.</i><br>I examined my apartment: Aside from this large living room there was an adjoining kitchen, two bedrooms, two bathrooms. What a waste. A family of four could live here comfortably, I thought on that first night, then later got used to the luxury. A welcome note from someone named Alice lay on the table&#x2014;she must be the employee of the CENTER who had signed the invitation letter, and it was probably she who had also thoughtfully left me bread, butter, and a few drinks in the kitchen. I tried a little of everything and it tasted foreign.<br>I worked out that back where I had come from it was already morning, so I could call without waking anyone up. After a few failed attempts with several <i>overseas operators</i> trying to help me, I managed to get the telephone in the tiny cabinet next to the front door to work, I dialed the right numbers and I heard, behind the white noise of the ocean, the familiar voice. That was the first of the hundred phone calls to Berlin in the next nine months. I said I had made it to the other side of the globe. I did not say what I was asking myself: What was the point? I did say I was very tired, and it&#x2019;s true, I really was, a strange, foreign tiredness. I looked for a nightgown in one of the suitcases, washed my hands and face, lay down in the bed, which was too wide and too soft, and didn&#x2019;t fall asleep for a long time. I woke up early, out of a morning dream, and heard a voice say: Time does what it can. It passes.<br>Those were the first sentences I wrote down in the large lined notebook that I had taken the precaution to bring with me and had placed on the narrow end of the long dining table and that quickly filled up with my notes, which I can now refer back to. In the meantime, time has passed, the way my dream laconically informed me it always does&#x2014;which was, and is, one of the most mysterious processes I know and one that I understand less and less the older I get. The fact that rays of thought, looking back into the past and looking ahead into the future, can penetrate through the layers of time strikes me as a miracle, and the telling of stories partakes of this miracle, because otherwise, without the benevolent gift of storytelling, we would not have survived and we could not survive.<br>For example, it&#x2019;s possible to let such thoughts flit through one&#x2019;s head and at the same time flip through the packet from the CENTER I discovered on the table in my apartment the next morning: &#x201c;<i>First Day Survival Information</i>&#x201d; for new arrivals. It listed the nearest grocery stores, caf�s, and pharmacies, described how to get to the CENTER and its rules of operation, and gave its telephone number, staffed twenty-four hours a day, of course. It recommended restaurants and also bookstores, libraries, scenic drives, museums, amusement parks, and guidebooks, and last but not least impressed upon the unsuspecting newcomer the proper behavior in case of an earthquake. I conscientiously reviewed all the information and also studied the list of my fellow scholars, from various countries, who would be my colleagues for the next six months, who would develop into members of a friendly community, and who have since scattered to the four winds again, or in other words, back to their various native countries.<br>A serious earthquake took place in the city only after my stay there, and the San Andreas Fault running under the city, shifting large masses of earth against each other, remains a constant threat. If someone had showed me a picture of the world of today, I would not have believed it, although my visions of the future were certainly gloomy enough.

" Macdonald (born Kenneth Millar) also wrote several novelettes and short-stories involving Southern California private-detective Lew Archer. "The Archer Files" for the first time collects all the brief Archer fiction: the stories from Macdonald s 1955 paperback-original "The Name Is Archer," the additional tales included in the Otto Penzler-edited 1977 volume "Lew Archer: Private Investigator," and the three then-unknown novellas presented in Crippen &amp; Landru s 2001 book "Strangers in Town." Also included in "The Archer Files" are several lengthy, never-before-published fragments of unfinished Macdonald stories: case notes, as it were, from the files of Lew Archer. Edited by Macdonald biographer Tom Nolan, "The Archer Files" is prefaced with Nolan s biographical sketch of Lew Archer himself -- the character Eudora Welty described as "a champion" and "a distinguished creation ... As a detective and as a man he takes the human situation with full seriousness. " Jeff Wong s cover is adapted from the 1955 paperback original, but depicting Ross Macdonald rather than Lew Archer.</p><p>Archer fans are in for a treat here, from the cover, based on a 1955 paperback original (substituting Macdonald's mug for Archer's), to the nifty biographical sketch of Archer by editor Nolan, all the way through a rat-a-tat collection of postwar-L.A. noir tales centered squarely on the no-nonsense private eye with an office down the street from Ciro's on the Sunset Strip. The characterizations of Archer are understandably lean&#x2014;in fact, the first two stories were originally about newspaperman Sam Drake&#x2014;but readers will gain a surprisingly full sense of the man from the collection. Archer is a tough, sardonic, well-read, hard-luck humanist who sets lyrical scenes as well as he makes deadeye shots. The murders he investigates are primarily passional, but there's usually a money motive as well. True, a few of the plots don't withstand scrutiny. But it's hard to resist lines such as He was indicted for homicide once, even in Chicago and I heard him retching. He had meant it literally when he said I made him sick. That's prose as sharp and durable as the detective's trademark charcoal-gray suits. Sennett, Frank</p><h2>Beyond the Great Mountains: A Visual Poem About China</h2><p>Ed Young&#39;s spare prose, as lovely as a rice-paper painting, describes in measured detail the beautiful and mystical land that the author so clearly loves. The unique format and gorgeous paper-collage illustrations, highlighted with Chinese characters, combine to convey the many facets of China to form a poetic picture of the land s grace, depth, and majesty.</p><p>Ed Young has illustrated more than eighty books for children (many of which he also wrote), and many of those books have been about China. Born in Tientsin, China, he is the winner of both the Caldecott Medal and the Caldecott Honor, in addition to many other awards. He lives with his family in New York.Grade 3 Up&#x2013;A stunning and uniquely designed picture book. Described as a visual poem about China, the book is comprised of 14 lines, each of which is accompanied by its own double-page illustration, done in cut- and torn-paper collage. Young also provides the ancient characters for the images he presents. Readers are able to read the entire poem from the title page since the pages are of graduated lengths, from short to longer, with a line of poetry appearing on the bottom of each page, overlapping just enough to allow for the text to show. Designed to be read vertically, each page is flipped up to reveal the accompanying illustration. In this way, the entire book becomes a piece of art, a visual treat of sublime colors and textures that joins with text and characters to describe the vastness and beauty of China. A chart shows the ancient characters that appear in the book, along with their modern-day equivalents. While the poetry, along with the illustrations and Chinese characters, may provide a creative experience that children can appreciate and enjoy, Young's rather abstract concept of visual verse, as explained in the author's note, will challenge most youngsters. Certainly, adults would find the explanation interesting, and would also appreciate the reflective poetry and images. An excellent choice for libraries looking for China-themed picture books.<i>&#x2013;Carol L.

She prefers good books to good looks and keeps both the royal accounts and the castle drawbridge in working order. When her greedy stepmother and stepsister scheme to spend the royal treasury and her father, the king, falls ill, Rosamond must set out in search of the one thing that can cure him -- the healing waters found in the magical well at the end of the world.<br>In the spirit of <i>The Talking Eggs</i>, award-winning author Robert San Souci has once again created a feisty heroine whose generosity and courage save the day combined with Rebecca Walsh's vibrant paintings. This is an adventure story that readers will turn to again and again.</p><p>Robert D. San Souci has retold numerous traditional tales and legends, including The Talking Egg , and The Faithful Friend , both of which received Caldecott Honors and Coretta Scott King Honors. He lives in Northern California.Kindergarten-Grade 4&#x2013;An author's note indicates that this story is loosely based on the British tale "The King of Colchester's Daughters." Princess Rosamond helps her father manage his kingdom. She's smart, but not much of a looker. All is well until the widowed king marries a beautiful yet greedy woman who also has a daughter. The two spend his treasury on clothing and jewels then demand that he tax his people at a higher rate. When the unhappy king falls ill, Rosamond takes off to find a magical well that contains healing water. She is kind to those she meets along the way and is amply rewarded with wealth, beauty, and love. When the stepmother and her daughter learn about her success, they attempt to collect some of the well's bounty. The selfish stepdaughter is rewarded in kind, with horrible ugliness. Upon her return, she attempts to fool a handsome prince into marrying her, but Rosamond saves the day and she and the young man live happily ever after. Done in a mixture of acrylic and watercolor, the richly hued illustrations vary in size from smaller vignettes to two-page paintings. They expand the narrative by imparting a fairy-tale setting and show lots of action and expression. Young viewers will enjoy the numerous small details. Consider purchasing this nicely paced story where fairy tales are popular.<i>&#x2013;Kathleen Simonetta, Indian Trails Public Library District, Wheeling, IL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The publication of A Manual for Cleaning Women , Lucia Berlin&#39;s dazzling collection of short stories, marked the rediscovery of a writer whose talent had gone unremarked by many. The incredible reaction to Lucia&#39;s writing - her ability to capture the beauty and ugliness that coexist in everyday lives, the extraordinary honesty and magnetism with which she draws on her own history to breathe life into her characters - included calls for her contribution to American literature to be as celebrated as that of Raymond Carver. Evening in Paradise is a careful selection from Lucia Berlin&#39;s remaining stories - a jewel-box follow-up for her hungry fans.</p><p>Lucia Berlin (1936-2004) worked brilliantly but sporadically throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Her stories are inspired by her early childhood in various Western mining towns; her glamorous teenage years in Santiago, Chile; three failed marriages; a lifelong problem with alcoholism; her years spent in Berkeley, New Mexico, and Mexico City; and the various jobs she held to support her writing and her four sons. Sober and writing steadily by the 1990s, she took a visiting writer&#39;s post at the University of Colorado in Boulder in 1994 and was soon promoted to associate professor. In 2001, in failing health, she moved to Southern California to be near her sons. She died in 2004 in Marina del Rey.

Nowhere is the new world order more apparent than in the writing of history, be it reexaminations of US cold war policy or a study like this, in which virtue and villainy seem much more ambiguous than they did a few years ago. The Khartoum setting is redolent with history (``Chinese'' Gordon vs. the Mahdi, etc.), but its implications (which ultimately have made Sudan one of today's foremost sanctuaries for terrorists) aren't part of Korn's story- -nor, apparently, of one victim's innocent remark that ``as long as I am in Sudan, I will never be in danger.'' Though we learn much here about Noel and Moore (both unquestionably capable and dedicated civil servants), the two exist at a remove, too idealized by the author to be truly sympathetic. Korn mixes engrossing chapters of on-the-spot action--detailing the kidnapping of the two officers and their murder after the Nixon Administration had refused to bargain with the kidnappers--with more disappointing background chapters (``To Be a Foreign Service Officer''; ``To Be an Arabist''). Though loaded with factual detail (of the Embassy driver's actions and loyalty to his US employers; of the background of a Marine on duty at the time of the killings; of the city's climate; of the layout of the embassy building), Korn's chronicle- -part professional report, part thriller, and part essay on the Foreign Service--lacks sufficient emphasis on the gray eminence of US foreign policy, which defined us for much of the Third World. Korn apparently wanted to write a hymn to virtue and patriotism--but his song seems old-fashioned, a tune from another era. (Photographs and maps) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Among their demands were the releases of Sirhan Sirhan, convicted killer of Robert Kennedy, and of Palestinians imprisoned in Jordan and Israel. President Richard Nixon--establishing a policy which remains in effect--refused to negotiate. This dire decision, as Korn reveals, doomed the three captives, set off an internal furor within the State Department and caused the White House to issue preemptive statements defending Nixon against accusations that the policy was a shocking display of indifference to Americans abroad in distress. The Belgian government attempted to ransom with money the release of its diplomat, Guy Eid. Korn, a former Foreign Service officer, presents a tense, compelling, carefully researched account of the abduction, the 59-hour siege of the Saudi embassy, the assassination of the diplomats, the surrender of the gunmen and their unexpected release by the Sudanese government. Korn explores the intriguing theory that Eid was used by Black September to trap Ambassador Cleo Noel and George Moore, deputy chief of mission, and was betrayed by the Palestinians.

When she made her rude reply, she stomped her foot, which caused the branch she grasped to shake as well.</p> <p>Douglas heard the danger before he saw it. A low, insistent drone, one that would have been undetectable but for the stillness of the stable yard.</p> <p>At Rose's display of stubbornness, the woman's hands closed into white-knuckled fists. "Rose," she said, her voice an agony of controlled desperation, "if you cannot climb down, then you must hold very, very still until we can get you down."</p> <p>"But you promised I could stay up here as long as I wanted."</p> <p>Another stomp, followed by another ominous, angry droning.</p> <p>Douglas took in two more facts: The child was unaware of the hornets' nest hanging several yards out on the higher branch, and she was not at all unwilling to come down. She was unable. He recognized a desperate display of bravado when he saw one, having found himself in an adult version of the same futile posturing more than once in recent months.</p> <p>He stripped off his gloves and stuffed them into the pocket of his riding jacket. Next, he shed his jacket, slung it across the horse's withers, turned back his cuffs, and rode over to the base of the tree. After taking a moment to assess the possibilities, he used the height of the horse's back to hoist himself into the lower limbs.</p> <p>"Miss Rose," he called out in the steady, no-nonsense voice his governess had used on him long ago, "you will do as your mother says and be still as a garden statue until I am able to reach you, do you understand? We will have no more rudeness"-Douglas continued to climb, branch by branch, toward the child-"you will not shout"-another several feet and he would be on the same level as she-"and you most assuredly will not be stamping your foot in an unladylike display of pique."</p> <p>The child raised her foot as if to stomp again. Douglas watched that little foot and knew a fleeting regret that his life would end now-regret and resentment.</p> <p>But no relief. That was something.</p> <p>The girl lowered her foot slowly and wrinkled her nose as she peered down at Douglas. "What's peek?"</p> <p>"Pique"-he secured his weight by wrapping one leg around a thick branch-"is the same thing as a taking, a pout, a ladylike version of a tantrum. Now come here, and we will get you out of this tree before your mama can devise a truly appalling punishment for your stubbornness."</p> <p>The child obeyed, crouching so he could catch her about the waist with both hands-which did occasion relief, immense relief. The droning momentarily increased as the girl left her perch.</p> <p>"You are going to climb around me now," Douglas instructed, "and affix yourself like a monkey to my back. You will hang on so tightly that I barely continue to breathe."</p> <p>Rose clambered around, assisted by Douglas's secure grip on her person, and latched on to his back, her legs scissored around his torso.</p> <p>"I wanted to come down," she confided when she was comfortably settled, "but I'd never climbed this high before, and I could not look down enough to figure my way to the ground. My stomach got butterflies, you see. Thank you for helping me get down. Mama is very, very vexed with me." She laid her cheek against Douglas's nape and huffed out a sigh as he began to descend. "I was scared."</p> <p>Douglas was focused on his climbing-it had been ages since he'd been up a literal tree-but he was nearly in conversation with a small child, perhaps for the first time since he'd been a child.</p> <p>Another unappealing aspect to an unappealing day.</p> <p>"You might explain to your mama you were stuck," he said as they approached the base of the tree. He slipped back onto the horse, nudged it over to where the woman stood watching him, and then swung out of the saddle, Rose still clinging to his back. He reached around and repositioned her on his hip.</p> <p>"Madam, I believe I have something belonging to you."</p> <p>"Mama, I'm sorry. I was st-stuck." The child's courage failed her, and weeping ensued.</p> <p>"Oh, Rose," her mother cried quietly, and the woman was, plague take this day, also crying. She held out her arms to the child, but because Rose was still wrapped around Douglas, he stepped forward, thinking to hand Rose off to her mother. Rose instead hugged her mother from her perch on Douglas's hip, bringing Douglas and the girl's mother into a startling proximity.</p> <p>The woman wrapped an arm around her child, the child kept two legs and an arm around Douglas, and Douglas, to keep himself, mother, and child from toppling into an undignified heap, put an arm around the mother's shoulders. She, much to his shock, tucked in to his body, so he ended up holding both females as they became audibly lachrymose.</p> <p>Douglas endured this strange embrace, assuring himself nobody cried forever. While he waited to extricate himself, several impressions came to him.</p> <p>The first was of warmth. Douglas had forgotten a human embrace could be warm, and the crying woman was warm indeed. Her body heat radiated against his chest, bringing with it the second impression: fragrance. She smelled of soap and something spicy-lavender with rosemary, at least. The child, whose hair was tickling Douglas's chin, smelled of the same soap and of the out-of-doors and of little-girl sweetness.</p> <p>Douglas hadn't known little girls had their own scent.</p> <p>And the final impression, strongest of all, was a sense of pleasure his body took in being close to a warm, adult female, one well formed and unself-conscious of their proximity. Douglas didn't censure himself for this realization-bodies would be bodies, after all-but neither did he allow himself to explore it.</p> <p>With a sigh and possibly a final, small lean against his shoulder, the woman stepped back, leaving Rose anchored to Douglas's chest.</p> <p>"Sir, I cannot thank you enough. Will you introduce yourself?"</p> <p>Now Rose was willing to hop down off his hip, but the girl disconcerted Douglas by taking his left hand and standing beside him. Mother and child wore the same expectant, teary expressions, and Douglas found himself unwilling to shake his hand loose of Rose's. She had, after all, been through an upsetting business-and she was a child.</p> <p>"Douglas Allen." He bowed over the lady's hand. "Viscount Amery, at your service."</p> <p>They were both bare-handed, so he dropped her fingers at the first acceptable moment, but not before he noticed even her hands were warm. Not hot, sweaty, or clammy, but warm.</p> <p>"Miss Guinevere Hollister," she replied, offering him a curtsy, then swabbing her handkerchief over Rose's cheeks. "Will you come up to the house for tea, your lordship?"</p> <p>"Tea would be appreciated." He slung his jacket over his shoulder, his one hand still held captive by Rose. As they turned to walk toward the house, Miss Hollister aimed a glower at the stable boys standing in the door to the barn.</p> <p>"For heaven's sake, Ezra, take the viscount's horse and see about that hornets' nest when it is safe to do so."</p> <p>Douglas heard her ordering the stable help around, but was preoccupied with matching his stride to a small child's.</p> <p>"You could carry me," Rose said, smiling up at him as if she'd divined his thoughts. She had dark hair in a riot of curls around a gamine face, and guileless green eyes.</p> <p>"Rose." Her mother's tone portended a sharp rebuke.</p> <p>Douglas swung the child back up to his hip. "We will have our tea that much sooner," he pointed out. When the girl laid her head on his shoulder and sighed like a tired puppy, he wished he had not been so complicit with her schemes.</p> <p>This child was the most... presuming person he'd met in recent memory. To his everlasting relief, when they gained the entry to the house, Rose was handed off to a footman with instructions that she be taken to her nurse, there to await her mother's judgment.</p> <p>Rose turned halfway up the stairs and waved at Douglas with the hand not clasped by the footman. Not knowing what else to do, Douglas offered the child a slight bow in response.</p> <p>This exchange was not lost on the mother-Miss Hollister, as she'd so boldly introduced herself-but she withheld comment on a grown man who'd bow to a grinning, waving child.</p> <p>"This way, if you please." Miss Hollister led him down the hallway to a small parlor toward the back of the house. As she rang for tea, Douglas rolled down his cuffs, shrugged back into his jacket, and took in the appointments of the room.</p> <p>The furnishings were more for comfort than elegance, this being in the way of a family parlor. A small blue velvet sofa was positioned under a window opposite the hearth, and two well-cushioned chairs with a low table of mellow blond oak between them sat along the inside wall. Before the hearth, but angled toward the center of the room, stood a sturdy oaken rocking chair.</p> <p>Silence had fallen between Douglas and his hostess while he'd inspected the surroundings. She regarded him from her seat in one of the chairs, her expression politely curious.</p> <p>"I invite you to be seated, my lord. I've taken the liberty of ordering some sustenance with our tea, it being nigh to luncheon and you having ridden out from Town, unless I mistake the matter."</p> <p>Douglas took the other chair. "You do not. Mistake the matter, that is."</p> <p>A small, pained smile crossed Miss Hollister's features, suggesting she would somehow rise to the challenge of exchanging pleasantries with a man who regarded small talk with as much affection as he did epidemics of influenza.</p> <p>"While I know our families are connected," she began, "I am at a loss as to why you would honor me with a call, not, of course, that you are unwelcome."</p> <p>She looked down at her hands. Douglas feared she was blinking back more tears, contemplating the morning's outcome had he not come to call.</p> <p>"Miss Hollister, the child is safe, and I have no doubt one of the grooms would have been up that tree had I not happened along. You must not dwell on the miseries that could have befallen you."</p> <p>Ignoring the miseries that had befallen one could also be useful, though Douglas kept that observation to himself. His hostess offered him a genuine smile for his assurances-false assurances though they were-then rose to accept the tea tray from a parlor maid.</p> <p>While Miss Hollister fixed the tea, Douglas recovered from that smile, from the sheer, dazzling surprise of it.</p> <p>His first impression of her had been one of plainness. Her features had been pinched with desperate concern; then she had been crying in relief. As he studied her over the tea service, he surmised that she sought to minimize her feminine attributes.</p> <p>Her hair, a rich, glossy chestnut, was scraped back in a severe bun. She wore a mud-brown dress, one without a single bow or ruffle. Her attire did the job of decently covering her with a vengeance, the collar coming up to her neck, the sleeves covering her wrists. But she couldn't hide a pair of wide, slanting green eyes, high cheekbones, or a generous, even lush mouth.</p> <p>Nor could she entirely disguise an amply endowed female figure, though from the cut of her clothing, she tried to.</p> <p>"How do you take your tea, my lord?"</p> <p>Her voice was as subtly lovely as the rest of her, a soothing contralto, though her hands had the slightest tremor as she maneuvered around the porcelain tea service. The teapot sported cabbage roses, all pink petals and soft greenery.</p> <p>She did not strike Douglas as a silver-tea-service sort of woman, which was appealing to a man who'd sold all but one set of good silver.</p> <p>"Strong, three sugars, no cream." A silence followed, one he knew he ought to fill with... words. Or something.</p> <p>"Are you always such a serious fellow?"</p> <p>"I have much to be serious about," he replied, taking the tea from her. Their fingers brushed, and a faint blush crept up the lady's graceful neck. How odd, that a woman in her position would blush so easily.</p> <p>"You have me at a loss here," Miss Hollister replied, busying herself with her tea. "While you are former brother-in-law to my cousin's wife-do I have that right?-I am not familiar with your... specific situation. May I offer you a sandwich?"</p> <p>She offered him two, heartily stacked with beef and cheddar, as if she knew the hours since breakfast for Douglas had been long and busy. He dragged his attention from the food on his plate-he even spotted a dab of mustard on the bread-and framed a reply.</p> <p>"My late brother was married to Astrid Alexander, the woman who is now your cousin Andrew's-Lord Greymoor's-wife," Douglas said. "His countess, rather. I find it curious you and I have not been introduced, but I understand from Greymoor you prefer to rusticate."</p> <p>With her bastard child, which hardly needed mentioning.</p> <p>"My doting cousin," the lady said, sipping her tea placidly. "Greymoor probably told you I am his steward here at Enfield-or perhaps he referred to me as his chatelaine if you caught him in a gallant mood." She had watched as Douglas demolished his first sandwich, but now excused herself to murmur something to a footman outside the half-open parlor door.</p> <p>Douglas waited until she was back in her seat, then got down to business.</p> <p>"Miss Hollister, I do not know what your cousins have told you about me, but if I am serious, to use your word, it's because I appear here today to solicit your assistance."</p> <p>She considered her tea with enviable calm. "I am in your debt, my lord. Any assistance I can render you, it will be my honor to provide."</p> <p>Those words were as much invitation as he'd hear, so Douglas launched into his rehearsed speech. "Your cousin holds your abilities as a manager of this estate in highest esteem. Greymoor says you have taught both him and his brother Heathgate much about the details of profitable landholding."</p> <p>This was not flattery, but rather, simply stated fact, and it had his hostess looking... bashful. Momentary shyness rendered her beauty even more alluring, lending her an illusion of innocence that made a man want to, well, nuzzle her. To run his nose along the line of her jaw, to inhale the fragrance of her skin and hair. To steal a march on her reserve and tease her into flirtation.</p> <p>What extraordinary thoughts. Douglas cut them off with brisk self-discipline, the way one might swat a ...</p></p><h2>Shoutin&#39; on the hills</h2><p>shoutin&#39; on the hills</p><p></p><h2>From Fauvism to Impressionism: Albert Marquet</h2><p>Albert Marquet (1875-1947) is one of the most forgotten and neglected artists of the twentieth century. His early career followed that of Matisse, his close and lifelong friend. They were students together of the French symbolist painter Gustave Moreau and were important members of the Fauve movement. After that brief early affiliation, Marquet refused to ally himself with any dominant art style, preferring instead his own intuition; consequently, he developed a unique approach which drew from both Fauvism and Impressionism but was entirely his own.<br><br>From Fauvism to Impressionism: Albert Marquet is the catalogue of an exhibition of Marquet's work that will be touring the United States for the next two years. It showcases the artist's energetic landscapes, portraits, and startling nudes, and is accompanied by new essays placing his work in the context of modern art. <br></p><p></p><h2>Time&#39;s Last Gift</h2><p>This is the 1985 Tor paperback edition.
